                            <p>The <title>Odyssey</title> tells the story as follows. Agamemnon,

                                    illustrate the social consideration enjoyed by the Homeric

                                    for his office. Athenaeus (p. 14 B) conceives this guardian
                                    minstrel of Clytaemnestra as a sort of cultivated domestic
                                    chaplain, whose function was not merely to keep her mind
                                    agreeably occupied, but also to edify her with examples of
                                    female excellence (<quote lang="greek">ἀρετὰς γυναικῶν
                                        διερχόμενος</quote>).</note> Clytaemnestra at Mycenae. The
                                precaution implies a sense of possible danger, but not necessarily
                                distrust of Clytaemnestra. Presently a tempter came to the lonely
                                wife in the person of her husband's first-cousin, Aegisthus, son of
                                Thyestes, who, while his kinsmen were fighting at Troy, dwelt
                                ‘at peace, in the heart of Argos<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">

                                messenger Hermes, warned Aegisthus against the course of crime upon

                                Aegisthus removed the minstrel to a desert island, and there left
                                him, a prey to dogs and birds. He then took the
                                ‘willing’ Clytaemnestra to his home; while he
                                sought to propitiate the gods by burnt-offerings on their altars,
                                and by hanging up in their temples ‘many gifts of

                                Argolis at a point not far from the dwelling of Aegisthus; who,
                                apprised by a watcher, came in his chariot, and invited the king to
                                a banquet; after which he slew him, ‘as a man slays an ox

                                subordinate to that of her paramour. Secondly, the vengeance of
                                Orestes is regarded as a simple act of retributive justice. It is
                                not said that he slew his mother; the conjecture is left open that
                                she may have died by her own hand. Nothing comes into the Epic view

                                power of the Dorians. It did so, not merely because that power was
                                an apt instrument for its propagation, but also because in Hellas at
                                large the time was favourable. The religion of Apollo, as his
                                Pythian interpreters set it forth, was suited to an age which had
                                begun to reflect, but which retained a vivid faith in the older
                                mythology. Here we are concerned with only one aspect of the
                                Apolline cult, that which relates to blood-guiltiness. The Homeric
                                man who has killed another may either pay a fine to the kinsfolk, or
                                go into exile<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In

                                    cases of exile were also frequent. In Homeric society the
                                    blood-feud is in process of being extirpated by these
                                    compromises; and, further, there is already a moral pressure of
                                    public opinion on the kinsmen of the slain man to accept the
                                    payment of the fine when tendered. See Mr Leaf's paper in the
                                        <title>Journal of Hellenic Studies</title>, vol. VIII. pp.
                                    122—132.</note>; but in Homer there is no idea that he
                                can be purified by a ritual. In other words, there is the notion of
                                a debt in this respect, but hardly of a sin; of quittance, but not
                                of absolution. It was a somewhat later stage when men began more
                                distinctly to recognise that in cases of homicide there are kinds
                                and degrees of moral guilt which cannot be expressed in the terms of
                                human debtor and creditor. Clearly a man ought to do what the gods
                                command. But what if a god tells a man to do something which most
                                men think wrong? If the man obeys, and if his conduct is to be
                                judged aright, the tribunal, like the instigation, must be divine.
                                Nor is this so only when the opinion offended is that of men. A god
                                may command a mortal to do an act by which some other god, or
                                supernatural being, will be incensed. Suppose, for instance, that a
                                man receives a divine mandate to slay a guilty kinsman; if he obeys,
                                nothing can save him from angering the Erinyes, who resent every
                                injury to kinsfolk.</p>
                            <p>For questions such as these the Pythian creed provided <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Purification from
                                    bloodguilt.</note> an answer, or at least a mystic compromise.
                                Apollo, the god of light, is the all-seeing arbiter of purity. A man
                                who commits homicide displeases Apollo, who abhors every stain of
                                blood. But Apollo can estimate the degree of guilt. And he has
                                empowered his servants to administer rites by which, under certain
                                conditions, a defiled person may be freed from the stain. In later
                                days the critics of Apollo could object that he had encouraged crime
                                by thus far alleviating its consequences. But in the age when the
                                doctrine was first put forth, it must have been, on the whole,
                                beneficent. It tempered the fear of capricious or vindictive deities
                                by trust in a god who, as his priests taught, never swerved from
                                equity, and who was always capable of clemency. At the same time it
                                laid the unabsolved offender under a ban worse than mere out lawry,
                                for it cut him off from the worship of the temple and of the hearth,
                                and, indeed, from all intercourse with god-fearing men. It made his
                                hope depend on submission to a religion representing the highest
                                spiritual influence which ever became widely operative among the
                                people of pagan Hellas.</p>

                                meanwhile the worship of the Pythian Apollo, with its ritual of
                                purification from blood, was diffused throughout the Greek world. It
                                was to be expected, therefore, that, when the story of Orestes began
                                to receive lyric treatment, the influence of Delphi should be
                                apparent. If, in avenging his father, Orestes killed Clytaemnestra
                                as well as Aegisthus, the Pythian priesthood had a text than which
                                they could desire none more impressive. For, according to the
                                immemorial and general belief of Hellenes, Orestes did well to
                                avenge Agamemnon. If, however, he slew his mother, the Erinyes were
                                necessarily called into activity. Who, then, was to vindicate the
                                avenger? Who was to assert, even against the Erinyes, that his deed
                                was righteous? Who but Apollo, the supreme judge of purity? And then
                                it was only another step to represent Apollo himself as having
                                prescribed the vengeance. A Greek vase-painting<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">On an amphora found in South Italy

                                sword of Orestes, who stands in a reverent attitude before him; he
                                thus consecrates it to the work of retribution. Behind Apollo, the

                                of Epos. In style and in dialect, no less than in choice of themes,

                                the fifth century B.C., depicts a scene which does not come from any
                                extant literary source. Orestes, wearing a cuirass, has plunged his
                                sword into the breast of Aegisthus, who is falling from his
                                seat,—the throne that once was Agamemnon's. Meanwhile,
                                something has startled Orestes; his face is turned away from
                                Aegisthus; he glances over his right shoulder at a woman who hurries
                                up behind him. This is Clytaemnestra, as an inscription certifies.
                                She grasps the handle of an axe with both hands; she is coming to
                                the rescue of Aegisthus. But an old man, wearing the conical hat of
                                a herald, has overtaken her; his left hand grasps her right arm, his
                                right, the axe; her purpose is baffled. Between her and Orestes
                                stands a maiden whose uplifted hands express horror; this (as the
                                artist informs us) is Chrysothemis. Vase A (as we shall call this
                                one) must next be compared with vase B,—another
                                red-figured Attic vase<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">A stamnos found on the site of Volci in Etruria, and

                                        <title>Electra</title>, p. 148.</note> of the fifth century,
                                but of later date than the other. The subject on B is fundamentally
                                the same as on A, but it is curiously abridged, or rather mutilated.
                                Orestes—who here is in full armour, with helmet and
                                greaves as well as cuirass—has dealt the mortal wound to
                                Aegisthus, and is looking straight at him. Clytaemnestra, furiously
                                brandishing her axe, is close behind Orestes,—so close,
                                that nothing can now save him from her blow. Electra (the name is
                                inscribed) stands behind the dying Aegisthus; her outstretched right
                                hand points at Clytaemnestra, her left is raised to the back of her
                                head with a gesture of bewilderment and terror; evidently she is
                                uttering a cry of warning to Orestes. The painter of B was led by
                                considerations of style or convenience to omit a vital feature of
                                A,—viz., the old man who stops Clytaemnestra at the
                                critical moment.</p>
                            <p>Now A and B belong, as Robert shows, to a small group of vases which
                                must have had a common archetype; and while A has preserved the
                                meaning of the whole scene more truly than B, the latter has
                                preserved some details which A has lost. The scene represented by
                                the archetype was probably as follows:—Orestes, in full
                                armour, slays Aegisthus, who falls from his throne; Clytaemnestra
                                rushes up behind Orestes, with an axe; Electra, standing at the back
                                of Aegisthus, cries out to warn her brother; but already the aged
                                herald has seized Clytaemnestra, and defeated her intent. Who is
                                this old man, the herald, who interposes so opportunely? He appears
                                along with Orestes in another work of art, earlier than these
                                vases,—viz., a marble relief, in the developed archaic
                                style, found at Melos<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Published by Conze in <title>Monum. dell'

                                    Elektra, p. 1238.</note>. The scene there is as
                                follows:—Electra sits in deep dejection at her father's
                                tomb; the aged Nurse stands behind her. Three travellers have just
                                arrived together; the foremost is the old man with the herald's hat
                                and stave, who is accosting the Nurse; behind him a youth of noble
                                mien (Orestes) stands beside a horse, his left hand resting on its
                                back; a third person (Pylades, or a servant?) follows. The question
                                is answered when it is observed that, according to a widelyspread
                                legend, the person who saved Orestes from the murderers, by carrying
                                him away from Mycenae, was Talthybius, the faithful herald of

                                been taken from some familiar literary source. It was essential for
                                a vase-painter's purpose that his version of a story should be
                                popularly known. What, then, was this source? Certainly not
                                Aeschylus. Vase A is assigned on grounds of style to an earlier date
                                than 458 B.C., the year of the Aeschylean

                                But, even apart from this fact, it is evident that the scene has not
                                been suggested by anything in the <title>Choephori.</title>
                                Clytaemnestra there calls, indeed, for an axe, when she hears that
                                Orestes has slain Aegisthus (v. 889): </p>
                            <p><quote lang="greek">δοίη τις ἀνδροκμῆτα πέλεκυν ὡς τάχος·

                            <p>But there is no time for her to obtain the weapon; at that moment
                                Orestes confronts her. Her futile cry rather indicates that
                                Aeschylus had in mind some earlier version which actually armed her
                                with an axe at a similar crisis. And in Sophocles, too, we find that
                                the axe is prominent. The murder of Agamemnon by the guilty pair is
                                thus described (v. 99): <quote lang="greek">σχίζουσι κάρα φονίῳ
                                    πελέκει</quote>. Still more significant is the passage in which
                                Sophocles describes the axe itself as resenting the deed of which it
                                was made the instrument (482 ff.):— </p>

                                    One of these sarcophagi, that in the Museo Pio-Clementino in the

                                    Erinyes, with the axe, occupy the left part of a relief of which
                                    the centre represents the slaying of Clytaemnestra and
                                    Aegisthus. Michaelis (<title>Arch. Zeit.</title> 1875, p. 107)
                                    was the first to point out that these Erinyes form a separate
                                    scene.</note>, on which the story of Orestes is treated, show
                                three Erinyes sleeping at the tomb of Agamemnon. Among them lies the
                                axe of Clytaemnestra,—a symbol, as with Sophocles, of the
                                crime which calls for vengeance.</p>
                            <p>The <title>Oresteia</title> of Stesichorus was popular at Athens in
                                the fifth century B.C. There is a striking proof of this.
                                Aristophanes, in the <title>Peace</title>(775 ff.), has adopted some
                                verses from the beginning of that <title>Oresteia</title><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The scholiast on

                                    Stesichorus, and in 797 refers to the <quote lang="greek">Ὀρέστεια</quote>. They are fragments 31—34 in
                                    Bergk.</note>, without naming Stesichorus. He could reckon on
                                his playful allusion to so famous a poem being at once recognised by
                                an Athenian audience. Between the <title>Odyssey</title> and
                                Aeschylus, no other handling of the subject seems to have rivalled
                                the work of Stesichorus in celebrity. In the epic
                                <title>Nostoi</title>, where the deed of Orestes was only one of
                                many episodes, it would be treated, one may suppose, on a relatively
                                small scale.</p>
                            <p>Now it is known that Stesichorus made Clytaemnestra kill her husband
                                by wounds on the head,—probably, therefore, with the axe,
                                as Sophocles describes in the passages quoted above. This appears
                                from the nature of the dream which terrified the Clytaemnestra of
                                Stesichorus just before the retribution. A serpent approached her
                                with gore upon its head, and then changed into Agamemnon:— </p>

                                        Lied</title>, p. 171) thinks that these two verses give only
                                    the first part of the dream as imagined by Stesichorus, and that
                                    the rest may be inferred from Aeschylus. When the serpent
                                    changed into Agamemnon, the offspring of his renewed union with
                                    Clytaemnestra was the serpent who, as she dreams in the
                                        <title>Choephori</title>, drew blood in sucking her breast.
                                    It has struck me that the missing link between the Stesichorean
                                    and the Aeschylean dream—viz., the renewed conjugal
                                    union—may be traced, as a reminiscence, in the
                                    language of Sophocles, where Chrysothemis describes her mother's
                                    vision (417 f.):— <quote lang="greek">λόγος τις

                            <p>Such a dream would necessarily (according to Greek ideas) act upon
                                her mind in the manner described by the Attic dramatists. In the
                                    <title>Oresteia</title> of Stesichorus, just as in the
                                    <title>Choephori</title> and in the Sophoclean
                                <title>Electra</title>, the guilty and terrified woman must have
                                sent propitiatory offerings to the grave of her murdered husband.
                                But, like the dramatists again, the lyric poet would make her send
                                them by the hands of some one else; even her hardihood could not
                                dispense with an intermediary in this case. Whom did Stesichorus
                                choose as her emissary? It is a notable fact that Electra, who is
                                unknown to Homer, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First
                                    mention of Electra.</note> appears in the fifth century B.C. as
                                a central personage of the story. And it seems that Aeschylus was
                                not the first poet who had spoken of her. The earliest writer
                                recorded as mentioning her is a lyric poet named Xanthus, who said
                                that her original name was Laodicè, and that she was
                                called Electra because she was so long unmarried (<quote lang="greek">ἄλεκτρος</quote>); an etymology which points to a
                                Dorian source (<quote lang="greek">Ἀλέκτρα</quote>）<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Aelian <title>Var.

                                    Lied</title>, p. 174 f. thinks that Megacleides was the source
                                    of Aelian also (see last note), and thus is our sole authority
                                    for the existence of this Xanthus. That Stesichorus mentioned
                                    some one named Xanthus cannot be doubted; but whether his debt
                                    to an earlier lyric poet of that name was such as Megacleides
                                    affirms, is (the critic thinks) very questionable. It is
                                    certainly strange that, if Xanthus was so important a source to
                                    Stesichorus, absolutely nothing should have come down to us
                                    concerning him, beyond the two meagre notices above
                                quoted.</note>. How far, and in what sense, that statement is true,
                                cannot now be known; but it is at least certain that Xanthus
                                remained wholly obscure, while Stesichorus was widely popular. The
                                introduction of Electra may be one of the points in which the
                                Stesichorean <title>Oresteia</title> was indebted to Xanthus: and
                                the fact of her figuring in that poem would fully explain her later
                                prominence. Let us suppose, then, that Stesichorus, like Aeschylus,
                                sent Electra with Clytaemnestra's offerings to Agamemnon's tomb.
                                Orestes, on his return, would hasten to make his offerings
                                there—as is assumed by all the three Attic dramatists. At
                                the tomb the brother and sister would meet and recognise each other,
                                as they do in Aeschylus. We know that Stesichorus brought in the
                                nurse, whom he called Laodameia<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 733." valid="yes">Aesch.

                                17.</note>. The Laodameia of Stesichorus may have done
                                likewise—giving Orestes to the trusty Talthybius, who
                                carried him forth, and in due time came back with him<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The relief from
                                    Melos has already been noticed, in which Talthybius and Orestes
                                    find Electra and the nurse at the tomb (p. xvii). The period
                                    indicated by the style of that work is the latter part of the
                                    sixth century B.C., when the <title>Oresteia</title> of
                                    Stesichorus was already well-known; and nothing is more likely
                                    than that the artist of the relief was indebted to that
                                source.</note>. After the recognition of Orestes by Electra at the
                                tomb, Stesichorus may have related the vengeance in the manner
                                depicted on the Attic vases above mentioned. We know that Euripides
                                was following Stesichorus in representing Orestes as defending
                                himself against the Erinyes with the bow and arrows given by
                                    Apollo<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol.

                                    Erinyes; and it is therefore not unlikely that the refuge of

                                with Talthybius, and is recognised by his sister. He then enters the

                                approximately correct,—and I, at least, am persuaded that
                                it is so,—the result is of considerable interest, not
                                merely in relation to Stesichorus, but also in its bearing on the
                                Attic dramatists. It would appear that Aeschylus followed the
                                general outlines of Stesichorus pretty closely; while Sophocles, who
                                did not do so, has retained at least one Stesichorean trait, the
                                part of the old man. Aeschylus did not need him, since
                                <emph>his</emph> Clytaemnestra herself sent Orestes to Strophius; on
                                the other hand, he retains the part of the nurse, which for
                                Sophocles was superfluous. But even if the hypothesis be rejected,
                                there remains that fragment of the Stesichorean poem which describes
                                Clytaemnestra's dream. This proves that Stesichorus conceived her in
                                a manner which was much nearer to the Aeschylean than to the
                                Homeric. And this change—whether first made by him or
                                not—was connected with another of still larger scope.
                                Stesichorus related in the <title>Oresteia</title> that Tyndareus
                                had incurred the anger of Aphroditè, who doomed his
                                daughters, Helen and Clytaemnestra, to evil careers<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Frag. 35. It was
                                    from Hesiod that Stesichorus derived this story. It is probable
                                    that the <quote lang="greek">Κατάλογος</quote> of Hesiod
                                    contained references to the crimes in the house of Pelops: see
                                    Robert, <title>Bild u. Lied</title>, p. 189.</note>. Here is the
                                tendency—wholly absent from the
                                <title>Iliad</title>—to bring crimes into the house of
                                Pelops. The Dorian conquerors of Peloponnesus envied the renown
                                which the old local lore, worked up by Ionian art in the
                                    <title>Iliad</title>, had shed around their Achaean
                                predecessors, the ancient masters of Mycenae and Sparta. Under
                                Dorian influences, the story of the Pelopidae was interwoven with
                                those dark threads which appear in Attic Tragedy, while brighter
                                traits were given to the legends of Heracles and the Heracleidae.</p>

                                story of Orestes is Pindar. In the eleventh Pythian ode (478 B.C.),
                                he describes a victory in the Pythian games as won ‘in the
                                rich corn-lands of Pylades, host of Laconian Orestes; whom, when his
                                sire was murdered, the nurse Arsinoè rescued from the
                                violent hands of Clytaemnestra and from her deadly guile.’
                                That ‘pitiless woman’ slew Aga memnon and
                                Cassandra. What, asks Pindar, was her motive? Was it ‘the
                                slaying of Iphigeneia at the Euripus’? Or was it an
                                adulterous passion? ‘Meanwhile, Orestes, a young child,
                                became the guest of the aged Strophius, who dwelt at the foot of
                                Parnassus. But in time, with the help of Ares, he slew his mother,

                                    the Homeric version on a point of such importance. It is
                                    certainly a curious illustration of Dorian influence in
                                    modifying the Achaean legends of the
                                    Peloponnesus—though, in this case, the influence was
                                    not permanent, as it was in blackening the family history of the
                                    Pelopidae.</note>. (2) The house of Strophius, ‘at the
                                foot of Parnassus,’ is the refuge of Orestes; and Pylades
                                is his friend. Probably the <title>Nostoi</title> (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 750 B.C.), in which Pylades figured,
                                gave this account; but Pindar is the earliest extant source of

                                    Pindar gives no countenance to the legend followed by Euripides,
                                    that Pylades was the son of Strophius. Pindar, he thinks,
                                    suggests no connection between them. “The home of
                                    Pylades in the ‘rich fields’ of Cirrha is
                                    distinguished clearly from that of Strophius on ‘the
                                    foot (spur) of Parnassus,’ that is to say at
                                    Crisa.” Is this so? Pindar first designates the
                                    Pythian festival by the words <quote lang="greek">ἀγῶνι...
                                        Κίρρας</quote> (<title>Pyth.</title> 11. 12), and
                                    presently adds that the victory of which he sings was won <quote lang="greek">ἐν ἀφνεαῖς ἀρούραισι Πυλάδα</quote>

                                    designated as <quote lang="greek">βαθυλείμων ὑπὸ Κίρρας

                                    6. 18. It is the spur of Parnassus under which Crisa was
                                    situated: there was no such <quote lang="greek">πέτρα</quote>
                                    or <quote lang="greek">λόφος</quote> near the site of Cirrha on
                                    the gulf. And, by adding <quote lang="greek">βαθυλείμων</quote>, Pindar interprets this large sense of
                                        <quote lang="greek">Κίρρας</quote>. In his time the town
                                    of Cirrha no longer existed (see <ref targOrder="U" target="cl180">n. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 180" valid="yes">Soph.
                                            <title>El.</title> 180</bibl></ref>). The plain in which
                                    the Pythian games were held extended from the site of Cirrha on
                                    the south to that of Crisa (the seat of Strophius) on the north.
                                    It was called ‘Cirrhaean’ as well as
                                    ‘Crisaean.’ Hence the festival could be
                                    called ‘the contest of Cirrha,’ and its
                                    scene could also be identified with ‘the cornlands of
                                    Pylades.’ Was Euripides (in <title>I. T.</title> 917
                                    f.) the first poet, as Mr Verrall suggests, who made Strophius a
                                    brother-in-law, and Pylades a nephew, of Agamemnon? It seems
                                    hardly probable. Anaxibia, daughter of Pleisthenes by
                                    Aëropè, and sister of Agamemnon, was
                                    mentioned by Hesiod (Tzetzes, <title>Exeg. in Iliad.</title>, p.
                                    68, 20); and as her only mythological function was to be the
                                    wife of Strophius and the mother of Pylades, it may be supposed
                                    that Hesiod knew those relationships. As we have seen, the
                                    association of Pylades with Orestes dates at least from the
                                        <title>Nostoi</title> (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign>

                                the view presented in the <title>Odyssey;</title> that the vengeance
                                of Orestes was a simply righteous retribution, by which the troubles
                                of the house were closed. To the mind of Aeschylus the version which
                                Stesichorus had followed would naturally commend itself: Orestes,
                                the slayer of a mother, could be saved from the Erinyes only by
                                divine aid. And the trilogy, the distinctively Aeschylean form of
                                work, was a framework perfectly suited to such a conception.
                                Clytaemnestra's crime is the subject of the

                                indeed, identifies herself with this ‘ancient, bitter
                                Alastor’; and the Argive Elders recognise that this dread
                                power, though it does not excuse her, has presumably helped her<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Agam.</title> 1500—1508.</note>. She is the
                                principal agent in the crime. Her dominant motive is not love of her

                                mourning, approaches. These are fifteen Trojan captives, now
                                domestics of the palace, who form the Chorus. They escort Electra.
                                Orestes thinks that he recognises his sister, and draws aside, with

                                supernatural allies who assist the vengeance. Zeus, Apollo, Hermes,
                                Hades, the spirit of Agamemnon, are felt throughout as if they were
                                present with the human agents. This is the significance of the
                                prolonged scene at the tomb, which forms more than one half of the
                                play. It is not properly a suspension of action, but rather a
                                dramatic prelude, emphasising the greatness of the issues involved
                                in the action to come. It brings out the heinousness of the crime
                                which calls for retribution, the appalling nature of the divine
                                mandate to Orestes, and the supreme need of arousing and marshalling
                                those superhuman forces which alone can secure the victory. The
                                human strategy, as subsequently developed, is not especially
                                skilful. The story told to Clytaemnestra by the pretended Phocian,
                                who mentions the death of Orestes as a bare fact casually learned
                                from a stranger, was not well fitted to find ready credence with the
                                astute woman whose fears had just been quickened, as the
                                conspirators knew, by a warning dream,—even if they
                                assumed that she had missed the meaning which her dream at once
                                conveyed to Orestes. And that Clytaemnestra did, in fact, suspect
                                the ‘Phocian's’ story appears from her wish that
                                Aegisthus should bring his body-guards. But then again the old nurse
                                of Orestes was hardly the safest person to whom a message of such
                                critical moment could be entrusted. The gods indeed justify the
                                maxim of Pylades; they are the worst enemies of the guilty.</p>
                            <p>From the moment when the two ‘Phocians’ enter the

                                unchecked, save by that brief pause in which the tragic interest
                                culminates,—the dialogue between Clytaemnestra and her
                                son. She holds the same place in the retribution which she held in
                                the crime. Her death is the climax; it is by her Erinyes that
                                Orestes is driven forth to seek refuge with Apollo. The fate of
                                Aegisthus is a subordinate incident<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 989 ." valid="yes">

                                the command which he obeys. In the play of Sophocles the oracle
                                briefly directs that he shall take the just vengeance without the
                                aid of an armed force. But in the <title>Choephori</title> he speaks
                                of reiterated admonitions from the god, full of explicit threats as
                                to the penalties which await him if he <emph>refuses</emph> to act.
                                Spectral terrors shall haunt him in the night; leprous ulcers shall
                                rise upon his flesh; his whole body shall be shrivelled and blasted
                                with torturing disease; he shall be an outcast, under a ban cutting
                                him off from human fellowship and from the altars of the gods.
                                Oracles of such a tenor plainly intimate that the task prescribed
                                was one from which even a brave man might recoil. Apollo's purpose
                                is to make Orestes feel that disobedience is the greater of two
                                evils. It is dreadful to shed a mother's blood, but worse to leave a
                                father unavenged. In the <title>Choephori</title> Orestes is indeed
                                resolute; not, however, because the duty before him is simple, but
                                because the god's messages have braced him to perform it.
                                Once—at the moment when a mother's claim to pity is
                                presented in the most pathetic form—he does
                                hesitate;— <quote lang="greek">Πυλάδη, τί δράσω;

                                asks what prayer she is to make. The Sophoclean Electra would hardly
                                have sought advice on that point; yet the question is in place here,
                                since her action, if contrary to the queen's orders, might
                                compromise her unhappy escort. The heroic fortitude and bold
                                initiative of the Sophoclean Electra are qualities which Aeschylus,
                                with his different plan, has not desired to portray; but he has done
                                full justice to her steadfast and affectionate loyalty. And with
                                regard to the actual mechanism of the plot, she is, in one sense,
                                even more important with Aeschylus than with Sophocles. It rests
                                with her alone to decide whether the young stranger is her brother,
                                and, if she is convinced, to aid his plan within the house. The
                                latter service is assigned by Sophocles to the old man, who could
                                also have established the identity of Orestes, if there had been
                                need. When the ‘recognition’ has been effected,
                                and the prayers at the tomb are over, the Aeschylean Electra can be
                                dismissed from the scene. Orestes directs her to go in, and watch
                                events in the house. She does not speak after verse 509, and is not
                                seen after verse 584; that is, she appears only in the first of the
                                three ‘acts’ into which the play may be divided.</p>
                            <p>The part of Aegisthus is notably brief, even allowing for the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Minor persons.</note>
                                indifference with which his fate is treated. He merely passes across
                                the scene; fourteen verses are all that he has to speak. The part of
                                the Nurse is a masterpiece in its kind. And we note the happy
                                inspiration by which Pylades is made to break silence
                                once—at the supreme moment—as the voice of
                                Apollo.</p>
                            <p>Nearly a third of the play is lyric. The Chorus have their <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Chorus.</note> share
                                in the action; at the outset they are the counsellors of Electra;
                                they persuade the Nurse to help the plan; and they send Aegisthus
                                forward to his doom. But their function is, above all, to interpret
                                the sense of reliance upon divine aid. ‘Justice may delay,
                                but it will come,’ is the burden of the choral song;
                                ‘the sinner shall suffer’ (<quote lang="greek">δράσαντι παθεῖν</quote>); ‘even now, Destiny is
                                preparing the sword.’ And when, at the close, a dark cloud
                                gathers over Orestes, it is with unwavering faith that the Chorus
                                commend him to Apollo, though no human eye can pierce the gloom
                                which rests upon the future.</p>

                                of the three Greek plays on this subject takes its name from
                                Orestes, though his deed forms the central interest. Aeschylus calls
                                his play the <title>Choephori</title>, because that title suggests
                                the claim of the murdered father—as
                                <title>Eumenides</title> expresses that of the mother slain by a
                                son—and therefore suits the link in the trilogy. On the
                                other hand, if the story was to be treated in a single play, the
                                    <emph>antecedents</emph> of the vengeance became especially
                                important. Electra, the daughter who, remaining at home, had been
                                faithful to her father's memory throughout the interval between the
                                flight and the return of Orestes, was the character best fitted to
                                supply the needful background. Thus far, Sophocles and Euripides had
                                the same motive for describing their subject by her name.</p>

                                the epic view that the deed of Orestes is simply laudable, and
                                therefore final. It suited this aim to concentrate the sympathies of
                                the spectators against Clytaemnestra as well as Aegisthus. And
                                nothing could be more effective for that purpose than to show how

                                    Prologue: 1—120.</note>The scene is laid before the
                                palace of the Pelopidae at Mycenae. Three persons
                                enter,—on the left of the spectator, for they are
                                travellers from a distant place. These are, Orestes, who is about
                                twenty years of age; his Phocian friend Pylades (son of Strophius,
                                king of Crisa near Delphi—from whose home they come); and
                                an old man, a faithful retainer of Agamemnon, who had been the
                                paedagogus of Orestes, and had secretly carried him, as a child,
                                away from Mycenae to Crisa, at the time when Agamemnon was slain.</p>
                            <p>The old man points out to Orestes the chief features in the landscape
                                before them, and then exhorts the two youths to concert their plan
                                of action without delay; already it is the hour of dawn, and the
                                morning-song of the birds is beginning.</p>
                            <p>Orestes, in reply, states the purport of the oracle given to him at
                                Delphi. Apollo commanded him to ‘snatch his righteous
                                vengeance by stealth,’ without the aid of an armed force.
                                He then sets forth his plan. The old man is to enter the palace in
                                the guise of a messenger sent by Phanoteus, a Phocian prince
                                friendly to Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus. He is to announce that
                                Orestes has been killed in a chariot-race at the Pythian games.
                                Meanwhile Orestes and Pylades will make offerings at the tomb of
                                Agamemnon near the palace. They will then present themselves in the
                                house, bearing a funeral urn. They, like the old man, will pretend
                                to be Phocians, who have brought the ashes of Orestes to Mycenae.</p>
                            <p>A female voice of lament is now heard in the house (v. 77). Orestes
                                asks if it can be Electra's, and proposes to wait and listen; but
                                the old man dissuades him. All three now leave the scene (v. 85).</p>
                            <p>Electra comes out of the house; she is alone, for the Chorus <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">（<quote lang="greek">θρῆνος ἀπὸ σκηνῆς·</quote> 86—120.)</note>
                                have not yet appeared. Greeting the ‘pure sunlight and the
                                air,’ to which her sorrow has so often been uttered at
                                dawn, she speaks of the grief which ceases not, day or night, for
                                her father, whom the wicked pair struck down, ‘as woodmen
                                fell an oak.’ She invokes the Powers of the nether world
                                to avenge him,— and to send her brother; for her own
                                strength is well-nigh spent.</p>

                                closing. They sympathise with her; and they do not conceal their
                                abhorrence of the deed which she mourns. But they remind her that
                                grief cannot restore the dead to life: they urge her to be calm,
                                trusting in the gods, and hoping for the return of Orestes. She must
                                not aggravate her lot by waging a fruitless strife with the rulers.</p>
                            <p>Electra replies that to abandon her grief would be disloyalty. If her
                                father is not to be avenged, there will be an end to reverence for
                                gods or men.</p>

                                to see and suffer daily in the house;—Aegisthus in her
                                father's place; her mother living with Aegisthus, and keeping the
                                death-day of Agamem non as a festival. Hardship and insult are her
                                own portion continually. The Chorus cautiously inquire if Aegisthus
                                is at home; and, on learning that he is absent in the country, ask
                                Electra whether she thinks that Orestes will return. ‘He
                                promises,’ she answers, ‘but does not keep his
                                promise.’ ‘Courage,’ they reply:
                                ‘he is too noble to fail his friends.’</p>
                            <p>At this moment Chrysothemis approaches, bearing funeral offerings.
                                She begins by sharply chiding her sister for this ‘vain
                                indulgence of idle wrath,’—in public, too, at
                                the palacegates. But she admits that she herself feels anger against
                                the tyrants; were she strong enough, she would let them know it.
                                Electra has right upon her side: only, if one is to live in freedom,
                                one must yield to the stronger.</p>
                            <p>Electra tells her that the choice is between loyalty to the dead and
                                worldly prudence. ‘Canst thou, the daughter of Agamemnon,
                                wish to be only the daughter of Clytaemnestra?’ The Chorus
                                timidly deprecate a quarrel. Chrysothemis says that she is used to
                                Electra's vehemence. She would not have spoken, but that she had to
                                convey a warning. As soon as Aegisthus returns, Electra is to be
                                imprisoned in a dungeon, at a distance from Mycenae—unless
                                she becomes more docile. Electra declares that she would welcome
                                such a doom;—‘that I may escape,’ she
                                says, ‘far from
                                <emph>you</emph>,’—thus identifying her sister
                                with the oppressors.</p>
                            <p>Chrysothemis, finding her counsels repelled, is about to proceed on
                                her errand, when Electra asks her whither she is taking those
                                offerings. ‘Our mother sends me,’ is the answer,
                                ‘with libations to our father's grave.’ It then
                                appears that Clytaemnestra has been terrified by a dream. Agamemnon
                                returned to life; he planted his sceptre at the hearth; a branch
                                blossomed from it, and overshadowed the land.</p>
                            <p>Electra feels a sudden joy. This dream, she believes, has been sent
                                by the gods below, and by the spirit of the dead. ‘Dear
                                sister,’ she cries, ‘cast those impious
                                offerings away; take, instead of them, such gifts as <emph>we</emph>
                                can give,—and pray at the tomb that our father's spirit
                                may come to help us, and that Orestes may live to
                                conquer.’</p>
                            <p>Chrysothemis is touched and subdued. She agrees to do as her sister
                                bids; only Electra and the Chorus must keep the secret; she dreads
                                her mother's anger.</p>
                            <p>The Chorus, encouraged by Clytaemnestra's dream, predict <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon:

                                slain her daughter, Iphigeneia, in the cause of his brother

                            <p>Electra replies that her father acted therein under constraint from
                                the goddess Artemis; but that, even if he had been a free agent,
                                Clytaemnestra's plea would not avail. Then, passing from argument to
                                reproach and defiance, Electra avows her wish that Orestes might
                                come as an avenger; though she also shows the anguish which she
                                feels at the attitude towards a mother which is forced upon her.</p>

                                will rule the issues of the vision for her good, and for the
                                discomfiture of her foes. Other wishes, too, she has, but will not

                                she openly recognises that the news is good. At last she will be

                                been honouring it. Libations of milk had been poured there; the
                                mound was wreathed with flowers; and on the edge of it lay a lock of

                                in memory of the dead youth. And now, as the delusive hope vanishes
                                from her sister's mind, Electra seeks to replace it by a heroic
                                resolve. Will Chrysothemis aid her in the purpose which she has
                                formed—to slay the two murderers with her own hand?
                                Electra reminds her of the joyless lot which otherwise awaits both

                            <p>To Chrysothemis this is sheer madness. She foresees only certain

                                1441.</note>Electra rushes forth to tell the Chorus that Orestes and
                                Pylades are about to do the deed Clytaemnestra is dressing the
                                funeral urn for burial, while the two youths stand beside her. In
                                another moment her dying shrieks are heard. Orestes, with Pylades,
                                then comes out; and, in answer to his sister's question, says:
                                    ‘<title>All is well in the house</title>, <emph>if
                                    Apollo's oracle spake well.</emph>’</p>
                            <p>Aegisthus is seen approaching, and the youths quickly reenter the
                                house. He is exultant, for he has heard the report that Orestes is
                                dead. Electra confirms it, adding that the body has been brought to
                                Mycenae; Aegisthus can satisfy his own eyes. The tyrant orders the
                                palace-doors to be thrown wide, in order that his subjects may see
                                the corpse, and know that all hope from that quarter is over.</p>
                            <p>The doors are opened; a corpse, hidden by a veil, lies on a bier;
                                close to it stand the two Phocians who are supposed to have brought
                                it. Aegisthus lifts the veil—and sees the dead
                                Clytaemnestra. He knows that he is doomed, and that Orestes stands
                                before him. Nor is he suffered to plead at length: though some
                                bitter words pass his lips, before Orestes drives him in, to slay
                                him in the hall where Agamemnon was slain. The Chorus rejoice that
                                the house of Atreus has at last found peace.</p>

                                first difference which appears is broader than any that could arise
                                from divergent views of the particular story. It concerns the whole
                                stamp of the drama, and illustrates the difference, in bent of
                                genius, between the two poets. Aeschylus exhibits in grand outline
                                the working of an eternal law, full of mystery and terror. Justice,
                                Destiny, the Erinys, are the paramount agencies. The human agents
                                are drawn, indeed, with a master's hand, but by a few powerful
                                strokes rather than with subtle touches or fine shading. Nor is much
                                care shown for probability in minor details of the plot. With
                                Sophocles the interest depends primarily on the portraiture of human
                                character. The opportunities for this are contrived by a series of
                                ingenious situations, fruitful in contrasts and dramatic effects. We
                                have seen that the Greek art of the sixth century B.C. knew a
                                version of this legend in which Talthybius, the herald of Agamemnon,
                                saved the young Orestes from murder,—receiving him,
                                doubtless, from the hands of the nurse—and in due time
                                conducted the heir home again; a version which Stesichorus had
                                probably popularised. It suited Aeschylus to leave out Talthybius,
                                while keeping the part of the nurse. Sophocles revives the old
                                herald in the person of the trusty Paedagogus, who received the
                                child, not from a nurse, but from Electra herself, and carried him
                                to Crisa. This change is a source of large advantage to the plot. It
                                is a weak point in the <title>Choephori</title> that the story told
                                by Orestes was not likely to impose upon Clytaemnestra, and does
                                not, in fact, disarm her suspicion. The Sophoclean stratagem is of a
                                different order. When the old man, as an envoy from Phanoteus, gives
                                Clytaemnestra his circumstantial account of her son's death, he
                                plays his part to perfection. He evinces some natural feeling for
                                the tragic death of a brilliant youth, but at the same time shows
                                that he is disappointed when the queen hesitates whether to rejoice
                                or to mourn. ‘Then it seems that I have come in
                                vain,’ he says, half aggrieved; and she hastens to
                                re-assure him. A little later the two ‘Phocians’
                                arrive with the urn, as envoys from Strophius, the old ally of
                                Agamemnon. This device of two independent missions, each from an
                                appropriate quarter, was really fitted to win belief. It also
                                provides a keen interest for the spectator, who is in the secret.
                                The Aeschylean Electra is from the outset the accomplice of the
                                avengers. But here she is herself deceived by them. And from the
                                belief that her brother is dead springs the resolve which shows her
                                spirit at the highest—to execute the vengeance without
                                aid. In the <title>Choephori</title>, again, Electra is still
                                trembling between hope and doubt, when Orestes steps forward, and
                                almost at once reveals himself. Here, she is convinced that his
                                ashes are in the urn which the young Phocian permits her to handle;
                                the irresistible pathos of her lament over it compels him to shorten
                                her probation; and then comes the dialogue, so characteristic of
                                Sophocles, which gently leads up to the recognition.</p>
                            <p>Like the poet of the <title>Odyssey</title>, Sophocles regards the
                                venge ance as a deed of unalloyed merit, which brings the troubles
                                of the house to an end. Clytaemnestra's part is much larger than in
                                the <title>Choephori</title>; but it is the death of Aegisthus which
                                forms the climax. Sophocles reverses the Aeschylean plan. Here it is
                                Clytaemnestra whose dying shriek is heard; it is Aegisthus whose
                                doom is preceded by a dialogue with Orestes.</p>

                                mother is liable to the Erinyes. This silence cannot be explained by
                                the plea that Sophocles was concerned only with the vengeance
                                itself. For, although the pursuit of Orestes by the Erinyes was not
                                to be included in the plot, still the play shows him both when he
                                was meditating the deed, and after he has done it. Yet he neither
                                shrinks from it in prospect, nor feels the slightest uneasiness when
                                it has been accomplished. From first to last, his confidence is as

                                audience, whose general sentiment would assuredly be that of the
                                    <title>Choephori</title>, and in the forefront of which sat

                                    generally referred to the Roman age, and no view has made them
                                    older than the time of Lycurgus (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign>
                                    330 B.C.). The inscriptions upon them are unquestionably of the

                                    for details of arrangement in the time of Sophocles. But they
                                    must embody, in the main, an old tradition: and they show a

                                (1886).</note> of the religious view which was so signally ignored?
                                Euripides is here, at least, at one with Aeschylus. True, Sophocles
                                has been careful to remind us, again and again, how completely
                                Clytaemnestra had forfeited all <emph>moral</emph> claim to a son's
                                loyalty. The question here is, however, not moral but religious; a
                                matter, not of conduct, but of kinship. It may also be granted that
                                the Sophoclean oracle of Apollo differs from that in the
                                    <title>Choephori.</title> It is a brief command to do a
                                righteous deed; it threatens no penalties, and so implies no reason
                                for reluctance. Still, that does not alter the fact of the
                                matricidal stain upon Orestes. I do not know any adequate solution
                                of this difficulty, which seems greater than has generally been
                                recognised: I can only suggest one consideration which may help to
                                explain it. The Homeric colouring in the <title>Electra</title> is
                                strongly marked; thus the <title>Odyssey</title> is followed in the
                                version of Agamemnon's murder as perpetrated at the
                                banquet,—there are even verbal echoes of it<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See commentary on
                                    v. 95, and on vv. 193—196.</note>; the chariot-race in
                                the <title>Iliad</title> (book XXIII) has furnished several traits
                                to the narrative of the disaster at the Pythian games<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See on vv. 712, 721
                                    f., 748.</note>. Sophocles seems to say to his audience,
                                ‘I give you, modified for drama, the story that Homer
                                tells; put yourselves at the Homeric stand-point; regard the act of
                                Orestes under the light in which the <title>Odyssey</title> presents
                                it.’ The Homeric Athena declares that Orestes has won
                                universal praise by slaying the villainous Aegisthus. The final
                                scene of Sophocles is designed to leave a similar impression; the
                                tyrant is exhibited in all his baseness,—insolent and
                                heartless; he is driven in to meet his just doom; Orestes points the
                                moral; and the Chorus welcome the retribution. Having resolved to
                                limit his view by the epic horizon, Sophocles has executed the plan
                                with great skill. But his plot labours under a disadvantage which no
                                skill could quite overcome. He could not, like his Homeric original,
                                dispense with Apollo: the Apolline thread had long ago become so
                                essential a part of the texture that he could not get rid of it.
                                But, the moment that Apollo is introduced, the thought of the stain
                                upon Orestes becomes importunate, since the very purpose for which
                                Apollo first came into the story was that of showing how the supreme
                                arbiter of purity could defend his emissary against the claim of the
                                Erinyes. Stesichorus and Aeschylus had deeply impressed this on the
                                Greek mind; and it would have been hard for Athenians, familiar with
                                the lyric and the dramatic <title>Oresteia</title>, to feel that the
                                story, as told by Sophocles, reached a true conclusion. His Chorus
                                might, indeed, close the play by describing the house of Atreus as </p>

                                to the dead, but the modes in which their characters are manifested
                                differ as widely as the situations. Antigone is suddenly required to
                                choose between omitting a sacred duty and incurring death; within a
                                day she has chosen, and died. The ordeal of Electra is that of
                                maintaining a solitary protest through years of suffering. Her timid
                                sister's sympathy is only secret; the tyrants ill-treat her, and she
                                witnesses their insults to her father's memory. Meanwhile there is
                                only one feeble ray of light for her, the hope that Orestes may
                                return; but it becomes fainter as time goes on. One of the finest
                                traits in the delineation of Electra by Sophocles is the manner in
                                which he suggests that inward life of the imagination into which she
                                has shrunk back from the world around her. To her, the dead father
                                is an ally ever watchful to aid the retribution; when she hears of
                                Clytaemnestra's dream, it at once occurs to her that <emph>he</emph>

                                amiable, sister. Chrysothemis is of the same type as Ismene; her
                                instincts are right, and respond to the appeal of Electra, whom she
                                loves; only she is not heroic. The stronger nature, when brought
                                into conflict with the feebler, almost inevitably assumes, at
                                certain moments, an aspect of harshness<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Vv. 391; 1027 ff. Cp. Introduction

                                    sends Electra a false message to the effect that Orestes (who is
                                    in exile) is dead, and that Aletes therefore accedes to the
                                    throne at Mycenae. Electra goes to consult the oracle at Delphi.
                                    She there meets a woman who (she is told) has slain Orestes; and
                                    is about to blind her with a brand snatched from the altar, when
                                    Orestes rushes between them—reveals
                                    himself—and tells her that the woman is her sister
                                    Iphigeneia. Orestes slays Aletes, whose daughter Erigona goes to
                                    Attica; and Pylades marries Electra. (Cp. Roscher,
                                    <title>Lex.</title>p. 1238.) The time supposed in the <quote lang="greek">Ἀλήτης</quote> was apparently just after the

                                    imposed upon Orestes by the slaying of his mother. Here, then
                                    (as in the presence of Iphigeneia), would be proof that in his
                                        <title>Aletes</title> the poet followed a different
                                    conception of the story from that which he adopts in his
                                        <title>Electra.</title></note>. Hers is the part which
                                Aeschylus gives to the Chorus, of speaking with Aegisthus on his way
                                to the house. She is present almost from the beginning to the end of
                                the play, and the series of her emotions is the thread which gives
                                unity to the whole. </p>

                                raigned and defended in the scene with Clytaemnestra. Sophocles
                                portrays the queen in a manner very distinct from that of Aeschylus;
                                a difference due not merely to the general tendencies of the poets,
                                but also to the dramatic setting. Aeschylus created his
                                Clytaemnestra in the <title>Agamemnon</title>, where she is seen
                                just before and just after the murder. There is a fascination in her
                                dreadful presence of mind; what an adamantine purpose can be felt
                                under the fluent eloquence with which she welcomes her husband<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ">

                                Clytaemnestra, not at a crisis of action, but as she lived and felt
                                in the years which followed her crime. Electra's fortitude was to be
                                illustrated by withstanding and denouncing her. The Clytaemnestra of
                                Aeschylus was ill-suited to such a situation. If she had been
                                confronted with a daughter who impugned her deed, scorn and hatred
                                would have flashed from her; but she would not have argued her case
                                in detail, and then listened to a reply. The almost superhuman force
                                of that dark soul would have been fatal to the dramatic effect of
                                any woman opposed to her. In the <title>Choephori</title> Aeschylus
                                has taken care that Electra shall have no dialogue with
                                Clytaemnestra. Sophocles clearly felt this. The Clytaemnestra whom
                                he draws is strong and wicked, but her temperament is not one which
                                separates her from ordinary humanity. She feels at least a pang of
                                maternal grief when she first hears that Orestes is dead<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">

                                taunts to Electra. She has not the Aeschylean queen's cynical

                                misrepresents her, and seeks to justify herself<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">

                                given voice to the popular belief that guilty love was the true

                                Electra and to assert the moral law: but there is a difference. The
                                Trojan slave-women of the Aeschylean Chorus hate the tyrants and are
                                friendly to Electra's cause, but have no further interest in the
                                vengeance. The Sophoclean Chorus consists of freeborn women,
                                belonging to Mycenae, but external to the palace. They represent a
                                patriotic sentiment in the realm at large, favourable to the son of
                                Agamemnon, and hostile to the usurper. The city is sympathetic with

                                <title>Electra</title>, we must not undervalue the dramatic
                                importance which Sophocles has given to the supernatural agency, or
                                the skill with which it is carried through the texture of the play.
                                In the opening scene we hear the oracle which Apollo has given to
                                Orestes. The enterprise is presently placed under the protection of
                                the Chthonian powers by those ceremonies at the tomb which, as the
                                old man urges, must precede everything else. Then Electra comes
                                forth, and invokes the deities of the underworld. A little later it
                                appears that Clytaemnestra has had an ominous dream; Electra sees in
                                it an answer to her prayer, and the Chorus express the same
                                conviction. Next, the queen makes her offerings and half-secret
                                prayers to Apollo; the very god, though she knows it not, who has
                                already sent Orestes home. With a similar unconsciousness, in her
                                joy at the news from Phocis, she declares that Nemesis has heard
                                those who deserved to be heard, and has ordained aright. The last
                                act. of Orestes and Pylades before entering the house is to salute
                                the images of the gods; while Electra makes a short prayer to
                                Apollo. Lastly, in the moments of suspense before the deed, the
                                choral song reminds us that the Erinyes have passed beneath the
                                roof, and that Hermes is guiding the avenger to the goal.</p>
                            <p>Thus the whole drama is pervaded by an under-current of divine
                                co-operation; the gods are silently at work; step by step the
                                irresistible allies advance; the very effort of Clytaemnestra to
                                bespeak Apollo's favour is a new impiety, which only makes his wrath
                                more certain. In the <title>Choephori</title> darkness broods over
                                all; the shadow of the curse rests upon the murderers, and then the
                                menace of the Erinyes comes upon the avenger. In the
                                <title>Electra</title> of Sophocles it is the bright influence of
                                Apollo that prevails from the first. Those sights and sounds of
                                early morning with which the play opens are fit symbols of his
                                presence; the powers of the nether world are also, indeed, active,
                                but here they are making common cause with the Pythian god of light
                                and purity.</p>

                                    that (1) the soil is too hard to receive a footprint, and (2) a
                                    brother's foot is likely to be larger than his sister's. When he
                                    lastly suggests that Orestes may have a garment woven for him
                                    long ago by his sister, she replies that by this time it must be
                                    much too small for him. Dr Verrall (<title>Choephori</title>,
                                    pp. xxxv ff.) thinks that the meaning of Aeschylus was subtler
                                    than that fixed upon him by Euripides. (1) The resemblance
                                    between the hair of Orestes and that of Electra was not in
                                        <emph>colour</emph> merely, but in some Asiatic quality by
                                    which the foreign race of Pelops could be distinguished from
                                    Achaeans. (2) So as to the footprints: the resemblance meant was
                                    not in <emph>size</emph>, but in the character of the outline.

                                    which the brother had with him. Euripides himself seems to make
                                    a slip here. Electra reproves the old man for suggesting that
                                    Orestes would have deigned, through fear of Aegisthus, to
                                        <emph>conceal</emph> his visit to the tomb
                                    (524—526). That, however, is what Orestes had done

                                But Aegisthus is now in the country, about to sacrifice to the
                                Nymphs. He has no guards with him,—only servants. Orestes
                                must present himself at the sacrifice, and take his chance of being
                                asked to assist. Clytaemnestra is at Argos. But Electra undertakes
                                to send her a message which will bring her to the cottage (v. 652).
                                It was customary that, ten days after the birth of a child,
                                offerings should be made to Eileithyia. The old man must tell
                                Clytaemnestra that her daughter entreats this pious office at her
                                hands, as she herself is unacquainted with the ritual (v. 1125).</p>
                            <p>The old man promises to take this message. He will also guide Orestes

                                oracle. He enters the cottage—resolved to do the deed, and

                                bids her Trojan handmaids assist her to alight, but Electra claims
                                the office, remarking that she herself is virtually a slave. Then
                                follows a dispute between mother and daughter as to the fate of
                                Iphigeneia and of Agamemnon (1011—1099). But the queen is
                                presently touched by Electra's misery, and expresses regret for the
                                past. Electra, however, is not softened. Then Clytaemnestra enters
                                the house, to perform the rite on behalf of the (supposed) child.
                                Electra bids her be careful that in the smoky cottage her robes are

                                Euripides is most patent. The dialogue is equivalent to an epilogue
                                by the dramatist, who, in effect, addresses the audience as
                                follows:—‘I have now told you this story in my
                                own way—adhering to the main lines of the tradition, but
                                reconciling it, as far as possible, with reason. And now, having
                                done my best with it, I feel bound to add that it remains a damning
                                indictment against Apollo, and a scandal to the moral sense of
                                mankind.’</p>

                                that guilt. He has divided the responsibility between Orestes and
                                Electra in such a manner as to make the sister appear the more
                                coldblooded of the two. It is she who plans the snare into which her
                                mother falls. While Orestes wavers and falters, Electra never
                                hesitates for a moment. She unflinchingly bears her part in the
                                murder, when her brother is fain to cover his eyes while he strikes.
                                Yet (as is brought out in the dialogue with the Dioscuri) she had

                                the noble and gentle side of her character is far more

                                    most repellent trait which Sophocles has given to her. But it is
                                    as nothing in comparison with the part which the Euripidean
                                    Electra bears in the actual deed; and it is also an isolated
                                    utterance at a moment of extreme tension.</note>. The general
                                result, then, is this:— Euripides gives up Apollo, who
                                told Orestes to commit matricide, as indefensible; while, by a
                                skilful contrast with a more odious person, he contrives to increase

                                who further thinks that the <title>Electra</title> of Euripides was
                                the stimulus which moved Sophocles to treat the subject<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Hermes</title>, vol. XVIII. pp. 214—263:
                                        <title>Die beiden Elektren.</title></note>. Certain
                                relations (the able critic contends) exist between the two plays
                                which show that one of them was influenced by the other, and a
                                closer scrutiny proves that the play of Euripides was the original.
                                I propose to examine this view.</p>
                            <p>The first resemblance to which the critic points is between <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The openings of the two
                                    plays compared.</note> the openings of the two dramas. In the
                                Euripidean prologue Orestes appears and speaks (vv.
                                82—111). Then Electra sings a monody (112—166);
                                and she is presently joined by the Chorus (167). In the Sophoclean
                                prologue also Orestes appears; then there is a monody for Electra
                                (86—120); and she is joined by the Chorus (121). Such a
                                coincidence, it is argued, cannot be accidental. And there is
                                internal evidence that Euripides was the model. For, with him, the
                                appearance of Orestes at that early moment is necessary; while, with
                                Sophocles, there is no reason why Orestes should be seen until he is
                                ready to enter the house. Again, the Chorus of Euripides have a
                                motive for their visit; they invite Electra to a festival. But the
                                Sophoclean Chorus come without any special cause. Nor has Sophocles
                                the reason of Euripides for composing his Chorus of persons external
                                to the palace; indeed, it is hard to see how such persons could have
                                established such intimacy with Electra, who was almost a prisoner.</p>
                            <p>In reply to this argument I wish to point out, first, that the
                                likeness between the two openings, in the particular points just
                                noticed, is immeasurably less striking than the general contrast.
                                The play of Sophocles begins with a dialogue between the old man and
                                Orestes, after which they and Pylades leave the scene. Electra then
                                comes forth and sings her monody. Euripides opens with a speech by
                                the farmer, who next has a dialogue with Electra. They depart.
                                Orestes enters with Pylades, to whom he makes a speech. Presently he
                                sees a slave, as he thinks—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> Electra—approaching. He and Pylades draw
                                aside; and Electra then sings her monody. Is it not manifest that,
                                so far, the openings are fundamentally different? But, it will be
                                said, the Parodos, at least, is, in each play, shared between
                                Electra and the Chorus; is not this suspicious? Even here the
                                contrast is stronger than the likeness. The Sophoclean Parodos is a
                                long ode of 129 verses, containing a discussion of Electra's wrongs
                                and hopes, and of the course which she ought to pursue. The
                                Euripidean Parodos consists of only 35 verses. The maidens briefly
                                invite Electra, and she declines.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me, then, that the openings of the two plays entirely
                                fail to support the critic's major premiss, viz., that one of them
                                must have been imitated from the other. But let us assume, for the
                                sake of argument, that such imitation could be proved. Is it true
                                that internal evidence points to Sophocles as the imitator? His
                                Orestes, we are told, has no reason for appearing at the house
                                before he is prepared to enter it. In defending a dramatist on such
                                a point, it suffices, I suppose, to show that the action is natural
                                and probable; we are not required to prove that it is necessary.
                                Orestes and his companions have just arrived, and have hidden the
                                urn somewhere near the house: the time is day-break. Is it strange
                                that they should reconnoitre the ground on which they will soon have
                                to act, or that the old man should point out the chief features of
                                the scene? As to the poet's motive, that is evident. His invention
                                of the double embassy from Phocis was a novelty, and he wished to
                                give a clue to it at the outset, since the spectator, who is thus in
                                the secret, will enjoy the play more. Again, it is said that
                                Sophocles bewrays his model when he composes his Chorus of persons
                                external to the house. A desire to vary from Aeschylus would account
                                for this as easily as a desire to copy Euripides; but why should not
                                the poet's motive have been independent of both? The free-born women
                                of Mycenae are exponents of the public goodwill towards the rightful
                                heir. But how, we are asked, had they become friends of Electra?
                                Chrysothemis and Clytaemnestra tell us, it may be answered, that
                                Electra frequently passed beyond the doors. Lastly, it is objected
                                that the Chorus come to Electra without a definite reason. Is there
                                not reason enough in their purpose of consoling and counselling
                                her,—the purpose which she gratefully acknowledges?</p>
                            <p>Thus, even if the openings of the two plays could justly be regarded
                                as showing a debt of either to the other, still there would be no
                                presumption that Sophocles was the debtor.</p>

                                support of the view which we are discussing. Both Sophocles and
                                Euripides bring Electra into controversy with Clytaemnestra. In the
                                play of Euripides, the tenor of this controversy is such as to
                                mitigate the odiousness of Clytaemnestra, and to emphasise the
                                hardness of Electra. This was what Euripides meant to do. The aim of
                                Sophocles was the opposite, to concentrate our sympathy upon
                                Electra. But, says Prof. v. Wilamowitz, Sophocles has involuntarily
                                given the advantage in dignity and self-command to Clytaemnestra;
                                and this shows that he has (unskilfully) imitated Euripides. Is it
                                true that the Clytaemnestra of Sophocles appears to more advantage
                                than his Electra? Every reader must judge for himself; I should not
                                have said so, nor, indeed, do I find it easy to understand how any
                                one could receive that impression. But, even if this were granted,
                                the inference of an imitation would still be unwarranted, since the
                                controversies in the two plays respectively differ both in topics
                                and in style.</p>
                            <p>Finally, let us consider the more general ground upon which <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Argument from general
                                    probability.</note> it is argued that Sophocles was stimulated
                                to write his <title>Electra</title> by the work of Euripides. The
                                Euripidean <title>Electra</title> is certainly a play which
                                Sophocles would have viewed with repugnance. He would have thought
                                that both the divine and the human persons were degraded. The
                                earlier scenes, with their homely realism, approximate, in fact, to
                                the stamp of the Middle Comedy. The whole treatment is a negation of
                                that ideal art to which Sophocles had devoted his life. It is
                                perfectly conceivable that such a piece should have roused him to
                                make a protest,—to show how the theme could once more be
                                nobly treated, as Aeschylus long ago had treated it, and yet without
                                raising the moral and religious problem of the
                                <title>Choephori.</title> But is such a hypothesis <emph>more</emph>
                                probable than the converse? Suppose that the Sophoclean
                                    <title>Electra</title> was the earlier of the two. Is it not
                                equally conceivable that Euripides should have been stirred to
                                protest against the calm condonation of matricide? Might he not have
                                wished to show how the subject could be handled without ignoring, as
                                Sophocles does, this aspect of the vengeance, and also without
                                refraining from criticism on the solution propounded by Aeschylus?
                                This, in my belief, is what Euripides actually did wish to do. But
                                assume for a moment that the other theory is right, and that the
                                Euripidean <title>Electra</title> was the earlier. Then, surely,
                                when Euripides had just been renewing the impression left by
                                Aeschylus,—that matricide, though enjoined by a god,
                                brings a fearful stain,—Sophocles would have chosen a
                                peculiarly unfortunate moment for inviting Athenians to admire the
                                unruffled equanimity of his Orestes.</p>

                                believing that the <title>Electra</title> is among the later plays
                                of Sophocles. It cannot, on any view, be placed more than a few

                                probable date is 413 B.C. The traits which warrant this conclusion

                                speaks once, so that the trimeter falls into two parts
                                (<emph>a</emph>, <emph>b</emph>). Taking the two latest plays, we
                                find 22 such examples in the <title>Philoctetes</title>, and 52 in

                                ranks between them, with 25. Next comes the <title>Oedipus

                                of iambic trimeters. The only parallel for this occurs in the
                                    <title>Trachiniae</title> (v. 1081, vv. 1085 f.), a piece which
                                may be placed somewhere between 420 and 410 B.C. (Introd. to
                                    <title>Trach.</title>, p. xxiii). It was an innovation due to
                                the melodramatic tendency which marked the last two decades of the
                                century. In the earlier practice, a series of iambic trimeters could
                                be broken only by shorter iambic measures, or by mere interjections.</p>

                            <p>(4) The actors have a notably large share in the lyric element of the

                                delivered by Electra as a <quote lang="greek">μονῳδία</quote>.
                                Such a monody can be paralleled only from the later plays of
                                Euripides. It is characteristic of the new music—satirised
                                by Aristophanes in the <title>Frogs</title>—which came
                                into vogue <foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 420 B.C.
                                (<emph>b</emph>) Again, the Parodos of the <title>Electra</title> is
                                in the form of a lyric dialogue (<quote lang="greek">κομμός</quote>) between the heroine and the Chorus. Here, too, it
                                is only in the latest plays that we find parallels. A
                                ‘kommatic’ parodos occurs also in the
                                    <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> That of the
                                <title>Philoctetes</title> has something of the same general
                                character, although there Neoptolemus replies to the Chorus only in
                                anapaests. (<emph>c</emph>) Another illustration of the same
                                tendency is the lyric duet between Electra and the coryphaeus in vv.
                                823—870, which may be compared with similar duets in the

                                the songs given to the Chorus alone are of relatively small compass

                                    influence of Euripides. But the danger of inference from a
                                    comparison of <emph>lower</emph> ratios is evident. The ratio in
                                    the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> is lower than in the earlier
                                        <title>Tyrannus</title>, and only the same as in the
                                        <title>Ajax</title>, which is the oldest play after the
                                        <title>Antigone.</title></note>. But, though a very great
                                    <emph>frequency</emph> of such resolution (as in the
                                    <title>Philoctetes</title>) has a clear significance, a
                                    <emph>negative</emph> application of the test would be, as the
                                statistics show, most unsafe; and, in this instance, all the other
                                internal evidence is on the opposite side. Those, then, who hold (as
                                I do) that the play was produced before the <title>Electra</title>
                                of Euripides (413 B.C.), will conclude that the years 420 and 414
                                B.C. mark the limits of the period to which it may be referred.</p>

                                comparison with the Greek dramatists, and especially with Sophocles,
                                that they claim a brief notice here. Each is, in its own way, the
                                work of one who has endeavoured to seize the spirit of antiquity;
                                who appreciates the charms of the Greek treatment; and who wishes to
                                preserve the beauty of Greek outline, while telling the story in a
                                new manner, such as he deems more effective for the modern theatre.
                                Each play thus becomes a suggestive criticism on the antique.</p>
                            <p>Voltaire was not the first French dramatist who had handled this
                                theme. Crébillon, whose <title lang="fr">Électre</title> appeared in 1708, had followed the
                                precedent set in the <title lang="fr">Œdipe</title> of
                                Corneille (1657), by interweaving love-affairs with the tragic
                                action: the son of Aegisthus has won the heart of Electra, and his
                                daughter is beloved by Orestes. Longepierre, whose <title lang="fr">Électre</title> was acted in 1719, failed for a
                                different reason; he preserved the classical simplicity, but lacked
                                knowledge of the stage and charm of style. Voltaire's
                                <title>Oreste</title> was produced in 1750. In the letter of
                                dedication prefixed to it, he says that his aim is to restore a
                                purer taste; and he thus describes the relation of his work to the
                                Sophoclean. ‘I have not copied the <title>Electra</title>
                                of Sophocles,— far from it; but I have reproduced, as well

                                scene is laid near the tomb of Agamemnon, on the shore of the
                                Argolic Gulf. Thither, from Argos, come Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra,

                                Electra, their slave, with fetters on her wrists. On the same day,
                                Orestes and Pylades are driven ashore at a neighbouring spot, and
                                fall in with Pammène<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As Pammène answers to the Sophoclean

                                becomes their accomplice. The disguised Orestes, with Pylades,
                                presents himself to Aegisthus, bearing a funeral urn. It contains,
                                he says, the ashes of Orestes, whom he has slain at Epidaurus. There
                                are, in fact, human ashes in the urn; but they are those of
                                Plistène, the son of Aegisthus, whom his father had sent
                                to kill Orestes. Presently Aegisthus learns by a message that his
                                son is dead. He promptly arrests the two young strangers, and
                                Pammène also. Meanwhile Orestes has met Electra at the
                                tomb, and, overcome by affection and pity, has made himself known to
                                her; though the oracle of Delphi had strictly forbidden him to do
                                so. Electra now appeals to Clytaemnestra—tells her the
                                secret—and persuades her to intercede with Aegisthus, but
                                without divulging her son's identity. Clytaemnestra complies.
                                Aegisthus—now certain that Orestes is in his
                                hands—spurns her prayer, and sends the two youths to
                                instant death. They are saved by a popular rising at Argos. The
                                people acclaim Orestes as their king. He then takes vengeance.
                                Electra hears Clytaemnestra's cry of supplication (behind the
                                scenes), and, believing that her mother is pleading for Aegisthus,
                                cries to her brother, ‘Strike!’<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Act V, Sc.

                                his work is the character of Clytaemnestra. He has caught up the
                                hint given by Sophocles (vv. 766 ff.), and carried further by
                                Euripides, that the murderess of Agamemnon may remain capable of
                                tenderness for Orestes and Electra. The Clytaemnestra of Voltaire
                                can be touched by the entreaties of her children, though she replies
                                to their taunts with anger and scorn<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title lang="fr">Épître</title> (prefixed to the <title lang="fr">Oreste</title>), p. 157. ‘<quote lang="fr">Rien n'est en effet plus dans la nature qu'une

                                of this personage,’ he says, ‘was in Sophocles
                                and Euripides, and I have developed it.’ In doing so, he
                                has gone a little too far; the ‘cri du sang’ is
                                somewhat too obtrusive and theatrical. Greek Tragedy, with its
                                severe sanity, would have felt that there was extravagance in making
                                Clytaemnestra intercede with Aegisthus for the life of one who could
                                return only as an avenger. Nevertheless, the French dramatist has
                                derived many touches of real beauty and pathos from this motive<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As in the scene

                                chief innovation consists in rendering the course of the stratagem
                                less smooth. Orestes and Pylades are placed in deadly peril. Our
                                hopes and fears alternate almost to the end. The demand for this
                                kind of interest is modern. An old Greek audience, familiar
                                beforehand with the main lines of the story, could feel no anxiety
                                for the safety of the hero. Voltaire's treatment of the urn-scene is
                                noteworthy. He saw that here it was impossible to reproduce the
                                Sophoclean pathos; that was only for people who had this custom in
                                respect to the relics of the dead,—a custom surrounded
                                with sacred and tender associations. Voltaire substituted an
                                interest of a different kind, —the thrill felt by the
                                spectators who know that the urn presented to Aegisthus contains the
                                ashes of his son<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">‘Il a fallu suppléer au

                                    in an essay published in the same year as Voltaire's play

                                    reveals the mind, if not the pen, of Voltaire, among whose works
                                    it has long been included: see Beuchot, <title lang="fr">Œuvres de Voltaire</title>, vol. VI. p. 255. The
                                    words quoted above are on p. 279.</note>. The device is
                                ingenious, but reduces the incident to a lower level; it is no
                                longer a dramatic beauty, but rather a stroke of theatrical effect.
                                A more serious departure from the ancient model is involved in his
                                attempt to vindicate the gods. He refuses to conceive that they
                                could have commanded an <emph>innocent</emph> man to slay his
                                mother, however guilty she might be. In his version, they ultimately
                                doom Orestes to do so; but only as a punishment. And for what? For
                                having failed, through love and pity, to persevere in obedience to
                                their arbitrary command against revealing him self to his

                                does not exhibit their justice in a more favourable light. So
                                perilous is it to tamper with Greek Tragedy on this
                                side,—as Euripides, indeed, was the first to show. The
                                inscrutable destiny interwoven with the legend is a thread which

                                    published in 1783, when the poet was thirty-four years of
                                age.</note>. More rigorous than the ancients themselves in limiting
                                the number of the characters, he employs only five
                                persons,— Aegisthus, Orestes, Pylades, Clytaemnestra, and
                                Electra. Sophocles is the classical poet who has chiefly influenced
                                him in detail; but he owes still more to Voltaire. His Clytaemnestra
                                is a woman broken down by misery and remorse; despised by Aegisthus;
                                upbraided by Electra; vacillating between hysterical tenderness for
                                her children and returns of the old passion for her paramour.
                                Orestes arrives, with Pylades, and is recognised by Electra merely
                                through the emotions which he manifests at the tomb of Agamemnon.
                                The youths then announce, first to Clytaemnestra and afterwards to
                                Aegisthus, the news that Orestes has been killed in a Cretan
                                chariot-race. Aegisthus detects the fiction owing to the folly of
                                Orestes, who, throughout the play, is incapable of self-control; he
                                is perpetually reproved, or helped out of difficulties, by the more
                                prudent Pylades. Aegisthus orders the young men to be executed, and
                                dooms Electra to the same fate. They are saved, as with Voltaire, by
                                an insurrection of the Argives. Orestes then takes the righteous
                                vengeance. He slays Aegisthus, and at the same moment, in his blind
                                fury, unconsciously deals a death-wound to Clytaemnestra, who is
                                endeavouring to protect the tyrant. The play closes with his
                                incipient madness, when he learns from Electra and Pylades that he
                                has shed a mother's blood.</p>
                            <p>Alfieri has a genuine, though limited, sympathy with the classical
                                spirit, and, unlike most of his modern predecessors in the treatment
                                of such themes, avoids everything that is positively incongruous
                                with that spirit. It is the more instructive to observe the reason
                                why he fails, in this <title>Oreste</title>, to be truly classical.
                                An Attic tragedy, though severely simple in outline, owes much of
                                its artistic charm to those minor incidents which diversify the
                                plot, and to those secondary persons who serve as foils or contrasts
                                to the chief actors. The part of the Nurse in the
                                <title>Choephori</title> is a small one, and yet how much the play
                                would lose if it were omitted! In the <title>Electra</title> of
                                Sophocles, the Old Man is not merely a link in a chain of agency,
                                but a source of dramatic interest: and the portraiture of the
                                heroine herself is the more vivid because Chrysothemis is placed at
                                her side. It is this variety and relief, this skilful use of
                                undertones, that we miss in the work of the Italian dramatist. He
                                has cut out everything that is not indispensable. Without deviation
                                or pause, the action pursues its direct, but somewhat monotonous

                                    Italian drama in the seventeenth century; but his endeavour

                                not that of a Greek drama; it is rather that of an abridgement from
                                such a work. Thus both Voltaire and Alfieri—the two
                                moderns who, in treating the story of Electra, have been most
                                closely studious of the classical models—have, in their
                                different ways, something to teach us with regard to those qualities
                                which distinguish the Greek masterpieces<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">M. Patin (<title lang="fr">Études sur les Tragiques grecs</title>, vol. II.

                                    which present certain points of interest. One is the
                                        <title>Clytemnestre</title> of SoumetAlex. , produced in
                                    1822, when the part of Orestes was acted by Talma. The influence
                                    of the Greek dramatists is mingled with that of Alfieri. Unlike
                                    his modern predecessors, the author makes use of Clytaemnestra's
                                    dream, to which he gives a new and striking form. From the
                                        <title>Orestie</title> of Dumas Alex. (produced in 1856) is

                                interesting, in conclusion, to observe how far the dramatic versions
                                of the story can be traced in that province. As might have been
                                expected, the Aeschylean trilogy has been the most influential. Thus

                                    Merope and her son Cresphontes (from the
                                    <title>Cresphontes</title> of Euripides); or Deianeira exhorting

                                    or Penelope and Telemachus. The group is the work of Stephanus,
                                    a pupil of Menelaüs, himself the pupil of Pasiteles, a

                                are Electra and Orestes. We are reminded of the sequel to the
                                recognition in the play of Sophocles, where the sister says, <quote lang="greek">ἔχω δε χερσίν</quote>; and Orestes answers,

                                1226); though the moment imagined by the sculptor is one when the
                                first transport of joy has subsided into a calmer happiness. It
                                remains to notice a slight but significant testimony to Sophoclean

                                Imperial age. Lucian describes a picture in which Orestes and
                                Pylades are slaying Aegisthus, while Clytaemnestra, already slain,

                                    Phocis, close to the Boeotian frontier, —about three
                                    miles west of Chaeroneia, and as many east of Daulis. He was the
                                    brother of Crisus, from whom the town of Crisa in Phocis (about
                                    two miles w. s. w. of Delphi) took its name. Between these
                                    brothers, said the legend, there was a deadly feud; before birth
                                    they had struggled in the womb (Tzetzes, <title>Lycophr.</title>
                                    939: cp. Preller, <title>Griechische Mythologie</title>, 2. p.
                                    54 n. 5). Now Crisus was the father of Strophius, that king of
                                    Crisa who was the ally of Agamemnon, and with whom the young
                                    Orestes found a home. Hence Phanoteus, the foe of Crisus, is
                                    represented as the friend of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra. He is
                                    the first to send them the glad tidings that Orestes is dead. On
                                    the other hand it is Strophius who is described as paying the
                                    last honours to the corpse, and sending the ashes to Mycenae
                                    (1111).</p>

                                    is most naturally followed by the dative of the instrument;

                                    is hard to see how ‘adding the report to an

                                    many such popular stories. Pythagoras was said to have hidden
                                    himself in a subterranean chamber, causing his death to be
                                    reported; and when he reappeared, he was supposed to have been
                                    born anew (schol.). Herodotus tells a similar story of the
                                    Thracian Salmoxis, a slave and disciple of Pythagoras, who thus
                                    converted the Thracians to a doctrine of immortality (4. 95).
                                    So, too, the poet Aristeas of Proconnesus disappeared for seven
                                    years,—as a sort of preliminary advertisement, it
                                    would seem, to his poem the <title>Arimaspeia</title> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt.  4. 14" valid="yes">Her. 4. 14</bibl>). It is vain to ask what
                                    particular story or stories Sophocles was thinking of; very
                                    possibly he knew those in Herodotus (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 337" valid="yes">Soph. <title>O. C.</title> 337</bibl> n.); but it was
                                    enough for him that his hearers would recognise the allusion to
                                    stories of that type. Hartung thinks that the reference is to
                                    Odysseus; but, as Odysseus did not contrive the rumour of his
                                    own death, the case is not in point.</p>

                                <p>I should agree with the schol. in governing <quote lang="greek">θυρῶν</quote> by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔνδον</lemma>, did not the wide separation of the words make
                                    this so awkward. When Sophocles places a genitive long before
                                    the preposition which governs it, the genitive is usu.
                                        <emph>causal;</emph> and, as this sense is readily

                                <p>These much-impugned words appear genuine. The murder has been
                                    prompted by the guilty love: <quote lang="greek">δόλος ἦν ὁ
                                        φράσας, ἔρος ὁ κτείνας</quote> (197). In Electra's
                                    thought, they are inseparable. The allusion to the love
                                        <emph>follows</emph> the reference to the murder, because
                                    she regards it as the crowning outrage (271 <quote lang="greek">τὴν τελευταίαν ὕβριν</quote>) that Clytaemnestra still
                                    lives with Aegisthus. Bloodshed was not the only sin which the
                                    Erinyes punished. They were the embodied sanctions of natural
                                    law, and every crime against the family came within their
                                    cognisance. (See <title>Introd. to Homer</title>, p. 51,
                                    § 13.) Indeed, Electra herself speaks of the unhallowed

                                        οὔτε λιταῖσιν</lemma>. The strophic verse (123) probably
                                    represents the true metre: <quote lang="greek">τάκεις ὧδ’
                                        ἀκόρεστον οἰμωγάν</quote>. On this point most modern
                                    critics are agreed, though they differ as to whether the verse
                                    should be considered glyconic or dactylic. But the correction of
                                    v. 139 remains quite uncertain. Many edd. have received
                                    Hermann's ingenious emendation, <quote lang="greek">οὔτε
                                            <emph>γόοισιν οὔτ) ἄνταις</emph></quote>. Doubtless
                                        <quote lang="greek">ΑΝΤΑΙΣ</quote> could easily have
                                    generated <quote lang="greek">ΛΙΤΑΙΣ</quote>. But the form
                                        <quote lang="greek">ἄντη</quote> is most dubious. Hermann
                                    relies solely on Hesychius, <quote lang="greek">ἀντήσει,
                                        λιτανείαις, ἀντήσεσιν</quote>. He supposes that <quote lang="greek">ἀντήσει</quote> was corrupted from <quote lang="greek">ἄντῃσι</quote>: though it might also have
                                    come from <quote lang="greek">ἀντήσε</quote>（<quote lang="greek">ς</quote>）<quote lang="greek">ι</quote>,—the second <quote lang="greek">ἀντήσεσιν</quote> being a later addition. There is no other
                                    vestige of <quote lang="greek">ἄντη</quote>. Erfurdt's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔτε γόοισιν οὔτ’
                                    εὐχαῖς</lemma> would be satisfactory; but then we should have
                                    to assume that <quote lang="greek">οὔτε λιταῖσιν</quote>
                                    arose from a perverse view of the metre. See Appendix. </p>

                                        <quote lang="greek">Κρῖσαν</quote> Hermann appeals to a
                                    grammarian of Hadrian's age, Dracon of Stratonicea, in his
                                    treatise <quote lang="greek">περὶ μέτρων</quote> (p. 21, 4).</p>
                                <p>Crisa stood about two miles W.S.W. of Delphi, on a spur of
                                    Parnassus, at the lower outlet of the gorge through which the
                                    river Pleistus issues into the plain. The <title>Iliad</title>
                                    mentions ‘sacred Crisa’ (<quote lang="greek">ζαθέην</quote>, 2. 520). But the Homeric Hymn to the
                                    Pythian Apollo is the best witness to its ancient power. There,
                                    just as here, the name <quote lang="greek">Κρῖσα</quote>
                                    includes the land which stretches southward from the town to its
                                    harbour on the ‘wide gulf’ (vv.
                                    253— 261). We need not, then, read <quote lang="greek">Κρίσᾳ</quote> or <quote lang="greek">Κρίσας</quote>.
                                    Crisa was the earliest seat of trade on the western sea; Delphi,
                                    when first founded, was merely a sanctuary in its territory.
                                    Pindar recalls the old prominence of its name when he describes
                                    a Pythian victory as won <quote lang="greek">Κρισαίαις ἐνὶ
                                        πτυχαῖς</quote> (<title>P.</title> 6. 18).</p>
                                <p>Cirrha, a town of much later date, was the port of Crisa on the
                                    gulf. About 585 B.C., the Delphians, aided by Cleisthenes of
                                    Sicyon and his allies, succeeded, after a long struggle, in
                                    humbling Crisa and destroying Cirrha. The Crisaean plain was
                                    then devoted to Apollo, whose domain was thus extended from his
                                    temple to the coast. When Sophocles wrote, that ground was still
                                    a <quote lang="greek">βούνομος ἀκτή</quote>, inviolable by
                                    plough or spade. It was not till the middle of the next century
                                    that the alleged encroachments of Amphissa on the <quote lang="greek">ἱερὰ χώρα</quote> gave a pretext for war to
                                    the Amphictyons (355 B.C.).</p>
                                <p>Ulrichs (<title>Reisen in Griechenland</title>) was the first to
                                    place the relations of Crisa and Cirrha in a clear light. Strabo
                                    correctly describes the site of Cirrha, but erroneously places
                                    Crisa to the east of it (9. p. 418). </p>

                                    giving her anything to hope for. It would be inappropriate to
                                    justify this (as the causal <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἅτις</lemma> does) by saying that she is pining away

                                    perfectly in place. (2) The very order of the words, <quote lang="greek">τεκέων...ἀνήρ</quote>, is confirmed by vv.

                                    is treated like a halfstarved slave. In v. 265 there is another

                                <p>Sophocles, who follows the Homeric story as to the banquet, could

                                    suggest to him that other <quote lang="greek">οἰκτρὰ
                                    αὐδή</quote> which she had uttered at an earlier moment,
                                    immediately after Agamemnon's return,—her presage of
                                    his fate, and her own: <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 1072" valid="yes">Aesch.

                                <p>The sense then is:—‘There was a voice of

                                    especially to Cassandra's laments, but also, perhaps, to
                                    forebodings in the mouth of the people at Mycenae.
                                    ‘And there was a voice of lamentation <quote lang="greek">ἐν κοίταις πατρῴαις</quote>, when thy
                                    father lay on the couch at the fatal banquet.’ The
                                    ‘voice’ at the banquet is, first, that of
                                    the dying Agamemnon; but Sophocles may have thought also of
                                    Cassandra's death-cry, which was sounding in the king's ears as
                                    he fell.—For other interpretations, see Appendix.</p>

                                    would shrink? Should I not deserve to be called <quote lang="greek">δυσσεβής</quote>? This seems forced; and it

                                    Possibly, then, the idea of Clytaemnestra's hideous festival may
                                    have been suggested to the poet by some actual commemoration of
                                    the event in Argolis. There was a cult of Agamemnon in various

                                    to be altered. It has been called ‘harsh.’
                                    But it is not more abrupt than <quote lang="greek">εἰδέναι
                                        θέλω</quote> in 318, and it suits the slight surprise with
                                    which Electra hears the question. The conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τό</lemma> (or <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τά</lemma>) <quote lang="greek">σοι φίλον</quote> throws an awkward stress on the enclitic
                                        <quote lang="greek">σοι</quote>: and <quote lang="greek">σοὶ</quote> would be inappropriate.</p>
                                <p>With the other punctuation, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἱστόρει τί σοι φίλον</lemma>, the words could mean
                                    only, ‘ask <emph>what it is that</emph> you
                                    wish’; not, ‘ask <emph>whatever</emph> you
                                    wish.’ Classical Greek writers use <quote lang="greek">τίς</quote> instead of <quote lang="greek">ὅστις</quote>
                                    only where there is an indirect question (as <quote lang="greek">λέγε τί χρῄζεις</quote>). In the Appendix I have
                                    examined the alleged exceptions to this rule. It will be found
                                    that, when they are real, they are post-classical. </p>

                                    imprudent. The chief theme of the timid sister's speech
                                    (328—340) has been prudence; as in 994 she insists on
                                        <quote lang="greek">τὴν εὐλάβειαν</quote>, and Electra
                                    says (1027) <quote lang="greek">ζηλῶ σε τοῦ νοῦ, τῆς δὲ
                                        δειλίας στυγῶ</quote>.</p>
                                <p>Other explanations are:—(1) ‘Choose to be
                                    thought either <emph>lost to right feeling</emph>, or, if you
                                    have such feeling, then at least <emph>forgetful</emph> of your
                                    duty.’ (2) ‘Choose to seem either
                                        <emph>unintelligent</emph> (if you are merely the blind
                                    instrument of our rulers); or, if you act with clear
                                    understanding (<quote lang="greek">φρονοῦσα</quote>),—thinking to benefit
                                    me,—at least forgetful of your father.’ Both
                                    these views assume that the question is merely between two
                                    interpretations which might be placed on the present conduct of
                                    Chrysothemis. But Electra is putting the dilemma between
                                    imprudent loyalty and prudent disloyalty. </p>

                                    explained by the context. In the preceding verses Electra has
                                    fully set forth her view: now she is summing it up, in words
                                    suited to a hearer of whose sympathy she despairs.
                                    ‘Enough for me if I do not offend my own sense of
                                    right’; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>,
                                    ‘I must obey my own instincts,—as you follow
                                    yours.’</p>
                                <p>Remark the resemblance to the passage where
                                    Antigone—summing up her position—compares
                                    the <emph>moral pain</emph> of neglecting her duty with those
                                    penalties which she contemns:—<quote lang="greek">κείνοις ἂν ἤλγουν· τοῖσδε δ’ οὐκ ἀλγύνομαι</quote>
                                    ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 468" valid="yes">
                                        <title>Ant.</title> 468</bibl>). There, too, we have a
                                    Sophoclean triad of clauses, the third echoing the
                                    first,—as <quote lang="greek">τῆς σῆς δ’ οὐκ ἐρῶ

                                <p>One of the scholia recognises the traditional reading, and
                                    explains it correctly: —<quote lang="greek">τοῦτο

                                    refers to some articles of food, perhaps cakes, which she (or a
                                    handmaid) was carrying to be burned at the grave (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 326" valid="yes">cp. 326</bibl> n.). Thus Lucian, speaking
                                    of offerings to the dead, says (<title>Charon</title> 22),
                                        <quote lang="greek">καίουσί τε τὰ πολυτελῆ δεῖπνα, καὶ

                                        ὡς γοῦν εἰκάσαι, ἐκχέουσιν</quote>. Chrysothemis, in
                                    her reply, naturally speaks of the <quote lang="greek">χοαί</quote>, since they formed the most characteristic part
                                    of the rite. But it seems impossible that the word <quote lang="greek">ἔμπυρα</quote> should directly denote the
                                    libations, as was supposed by the schol. (<quote lang="greek">τάδ’ ἔμπυρα· ταύτας τὰς σπονδάς</quote>), and by
                                    Triclinius. There is nothing to show that the term <quote lang="greek">ἔμπυρα</quote>, ‘burnt

                                    ‘offerings at a <quote lang="greek">πυρά</quote>’ (as the grave is called in 901). In
                                    the only other place where Sophocles uses the word <quote lang="greek">ἔμπυρα</quote>, it has its ordinary sense (

                                <p> These three verses, which the MSS. give to Electra, and which
                                    several recent critics reject (cr. n.), clearly belong to
                                    Chrysothemis, and are genuine. Electra's exclamation of joy
                                    (411) caused Chrysothemis to ask if her sister had any ground
                                    for hope (412). Electra replied that, when she had heard the
                                    dream, she would say. This showed her sister that Electra relied
                                    merely on the fact that Clytaemnestra had seen <emph>some</emph>
                                    fearful vision. Now, therefore, instead of asking for Electra's
                                    interpretation, she merely repeats her counsel (383 f.) before
                                    proceeding on her errand. The words <quote lang="greek">πρός
                                            <emph>νυν</emph> θεῶν κ.τ.λ.</quote> (428 ff.) show the
                                    train of her thought. To Chrysothemis, the alarm of
                                    Clytaemnestra (427) is more important than the apparition of
                                    Agamemnon. The dream is only a new reason why Electra should be
                                    cautious,—not why she should hope.</p>
                                <p>The current ascription of the verses to Electra was doubtless
                                    prompted by verse 413. It was supposed that the recital of
                                    Chrysothemis must be immediately followed by the comments of
                                    Electra. But, as Hermann observed, the phrase <quote lang="greek">ἀβουλίᾳ πεσεῖν</quote> would alone suffice
                                    to show that the verses belong to Chrysothemis (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 398" valid="yes">cp. 398</bibl>). Nor could the warning,
                                        <quote lang="greek">σὺν κακῷ μέτει πάλιν</quote>, be
                                    fitly uttered by Electra. </p>

                                        <title>Troilus</title> Sophocles used the phrase <quote lang="greek">πλήρη μασχαλισμάτων</quote>, and probably
                                    also <quote lang="greek">τὸν μασχαλισμόν</quote> (fr. 566).
                                    The explanation given by the scholiasts and the lexicographers
                                    dates at least from Aristophanes of Byzantium (see Appendix).
                                    Murderers used to cut off the extremities of their victim, and
                                    suspend these at his arm-pits (<quote lang="greek">μασχάλαι</quote>) and from his neck. Hence <quote lang="greek">μασχαλίζω</quote> is paraphrased by <quote lang="greek">ἀκρωτηριάζω</quote>.</p>
                                <p>Two different motives are assigned by the Greek commentators;
                                    viz.:—(1) the desire to render the dead incapable of
                                    wreaking vengeance (<quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ τὴν δύναμιν
                                        ἐκείνων ἀφαιρούμενοι</quote>): (2) the desire to make an
                                    atonement (<quote lang="greek">ἐξιλάσασθαι τὴν
                                        δολοφονίαν—ἀφοσιοῦσθαι τὸν φόνον</quote>).
                                    There can be little doubt that the first of these motives was
                                    the primitive origin of the custom. If the second was afterwards
                                    blended with it, the idea may have been that of offering the
                                    severed portions to the gods below,—as a victim was
                                    devoted to death by cutting off a lock of hair ( <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Alc. 75" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Alc.</title> 75</bibl>).
                                    Apollonius Rhodius seems to present the practice in this light
                                    (4. 477): Jason, having slain a foe, <quote lang="greek">ἐξάργματα τάμνε θανόντος</quote>. Cp. <title>Etym.

                                    here accepts the lock of hair and the girdle which Electra
                                    offers to her. We must suppose that, after leaving the scene,
                                    she puts Clytaemnestra's gifts somewhere out of sight.</p>

                                    room for disputing,— one should act

                                    the first.</p>
                                <p>(1) <quote lang="greek">τὸ δίκαιον</quote> is an acc. of

                                    λόγον</quote> is impersonal. ‘With regard to what is

                                    rather both should hasten on the doing (of it).’ With

                                    <quote lang="greek">ἔχει λόγον δυοῖν ἐρίζειν</quote>. (The
                                    first scholium gives substantially this view: <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔχει λόγον φιλονεικεῖν περὶ τοῦ

                                <p>(2) Or <quote lang="greek">τὸ δίκαιον</quote> might be nom.:
                                    ‘that which is clearly right does not <emph>afford any
                                        ground</emph> (<quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔχει
                                    λόγον</quote>) for two persons to dispute,’ etc. So
                                    the second schol.: <quote lang="greek">ἢ τὸ οὐκ ἔχει
                                        λόγον ἀντὶ τοῦ οὐ παρέχει πρόφασιν</quote>. So far as
                                    the verb <quote lang="greek">ἔχει</quote> is concerned, this
                                    sense is quite admissible: cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc.  2. 41" valid="yes">Thuc. 2.
                                        41</bibl><quote lang="greek">οὔτε τῷ πολεμίῳ

                                    phrases <quote lang="greek">ἔχειν λόγον, οὐκ ἔχειν
                                    λόγον</quote>, which are very common, regularly mean,

                                    unreasonable.’ This is so both in the personal and in
                                    the impersonal constr.; as Plat. <title>Phaedo</title>p. 62 D
                                        <quote lang="greek">τὸ γὰρ μὴ ἀγανακτεῖν...οὐκ ἔχει

                                <p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δυοῖν</lemma> is taken by
                                    Hermann and others to mean Electra and the Chorus.
                                    ‘The right view (of the matter) affords no ground for
                                    me to contend against you both.’ But the controversy
                                    of Chrysothemis has been with Electra only. She is yielding to a
                                    new perception of her duty, not to a majority of voices. </p>

                                <p>Oenomaüs, king of Pisa in Elis, had promised the hand of

                                    a chariot-race; the penalty of failure being death. The young
                                    Pelops, son of Tantalus, offered himself as a competitor.
                                    Myrtilus, the charioteer of Oenomaüs, was persuaded
                                    (either by Hippodameia or by Pelops) to betray his master. He
                                    did so by leaving out one or both of the linch-pins by which the
                                    naves of the chariot-wheels were secured to the axles.

                                    for Myrtilus insulted Hippodameia, and was thrown into the sea
                                    by Pelops; upon whose house he invoked a curse, as he sank.</p>

                                    of the group. Zeus occupied the centre; to the right of him were
                                    Pelops and Hippodameia; to the left, Oenomaüs and his
                                    wife Steropè. On each side was a chariot drawn by
                                    four horses. Myrtilus was sitting in front of his team, with his
                                    face turned away from his master.</p>

                                    is the only construction of the words which fits <quote lang="greek">Ἀργείων</quote> in 535. The twofold question

                                <p> Clytaemnestra has argued that she was justified in slaying
                                    Agamemnon, because he had slain Iphigeneia. The topics of
                                    Electra's reply are as follows.</p>
                                <p>(1) 558—562. The wife who slew her husband would be a
                                    criminal, even if the motive had been just retribution; but the
                                    real motive was her love for Aegisthus. (2) 563—576.
                                    Agamemnon was not a free agent in slaying Iphigeneia; the act
                                    was forced upon him by Artemis. (3) 577—583. Suppose,
                                    however, that he was a free agent, and wished to please his
                                    brother; still she was not justified in taking his life. (4)
                                    584—594. And in any case her plea does not excuse her
                                    for living with the man who helped to slay her
                                    husband.—The speech then closes in a strain of
                                    reproach and defiance (595 —609). </p>

                                    part).’ Electra's speech, which began with temperate
                                    argument, has passed (at v. 595) into a strain of angry
                                    reproach— closing with the avowal that she would have
                                    wished to see Orestes take blood for blood (604 f.). The leader

                                    It would be awkward (1) to understand <quote lang="greek">τὸ
                                        μένος ξύνεστιν αὐτῇ</quote> (schol.); or (2) <quote lang="greek">ἐκείνη ξύνεστι τῷ μένει</quote> (Herm. ).
                                    The conj. of Blaydes, <quote lang="greek">εἰ δὲ σοὶ
                                    δίκη</quote> etc., yields a clear phrase (cp.
                                    <title>O.T.</title> 274 f.): but <quote lang="greek">σοὶ</quote> is objectionable. He understands, ‘I see
                                    that Electra is angry; but you (Clytaemnestra) do not consider
                                    whether she is in the right.’ Paley, who adopts this
                                    conjecture, takes <quote lang="greek">πνέουσαν</quote> to mean
                                    Clyt., and <quote lang="greek">σοὶ</quote>, Electra.</p>
                                <p>Other interpretations are:—(1) ‘I see that
                                    Electra is wroth; but as to whether she is in the right, I see
                                    no concern (anywhere),’—a timid way of
                                    saying that <title>Clytaemnestra</title> shows no such concern.
                                    So the schol. (2) ‘I see that Clytaemnestra is angry,
                                    but not that she cares whether she is
                                    right’:—an inference from some gesture. Both
                                    these versions rely on the fact that <quote lang="greek">φροντίδος</quote> (612) is plainly an echo of <quote lang="greek">φροντίδ)</quote> (611). But: (<emph>a</emph>）
                                    it does not follow that <quote lang="greek">φροντίδ)</quote> is
                                    not <title>Electra's</title> thought. (<emph>b</emph>) It is
                                    surely clear that <quote lang="greek">πνέουσαν</quote> must be
                                    Electra; and (<emph>c</emph>) as in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 471" valid="yes">

                                    the attempts to amend this v., see Appendix. The criticism of
                                    vv. 690—692 turns upon these points. (1) The word
                                        <quote lang="greek">διαύλων</quote> cannot be right. At
                                    each festival there was only one <quote lang="greek">δίαυλος</quote>. The plur. cannot be defended on the ground
                                    that a winner of the <quote lang="greek">δίαυλος</quote> might
                                    have to run twice,— viz., first in one of several
                                    groups, and then in the final heat ( <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 6. 13. 3" valid="yes">Paus. 6. 13. 3</bibl>). (2) If the sing. <quote lang="greek">διαύλου</quote> be read, it is still difficult
                                    to complete the verse in any probable manner. (3) Omitting
                                        <quote lang="greek">διαύλων</quote>, we might expand <quote lang="greek">πένταθλ’ ἃ νομίζεται</quote> on the
                                    hypothesis that the intrusion of <quote lang="greek">διαύλων</quote> had caused the mischief: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, <quote lang="greek">δρόμων, πόνων τε
                                        πεμπὰς ἣ νομίζεται</quote>. Pindar often uses <quote lang="greek">πόνος</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">ἆθλος</quote>. (4) But it seems more probable that v. 691 is
                                    an interpolation, arising perhaps from a marginal gloss, and
                                    intended to explain a general phrase in the text. Thus, if the
                                    poet had written simply, <quote lang="greek">ὅσων γὰρ
                                        εἰσεκήρυξαν βραβῆς</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ἄθλων ἐνεγκὼν</quote> etc., then the
                                    reference to the diaulos and the pentathlon in v. 691 might have
                                    been prompted by a wish to define <quote lang="greek">ἄθλων</quote>. And the interpolation would itself account for
                                    the change of <quote lang="greek">ἄθλων</quote> in 692 to
                                        <quote lang="greek">τούτων</quote>. (Some, indeed, think it
                                    enough to delete 691, leaving <quote lang="greek">τούτων</quote>: but the neut. plur. of the pron. seems too
                                    vague here.) (5) Nauck's view, that the poet wrote, <quote lang="greek">ὅσων γὰρ εἰσεκήρυξαν βραβῆς</quote>
                                    | <quote lang="greek">δρόμων ἐνεγκὼν</quote> etc.,
                                    leaves two difficulties. (<emph>a</emph>) There would then have
                                    been less excuse for interpolating an allusion to the
                                    pentathlon. (<emph>b</emph>) The tone of vv. 688 f. would lead
                                    us to suppose that the <quote lang="greek">ἔργα καὶ
                                    κράτη</quote> of Orestes had not been confined to footraces,

                                <p>On the whole, I should incline to delete 691, and alter <quote lang="greek">τούτων</quote> in 692 to <quote lang="greek">ἄθλων</quote>. </p>

                                    364 B.C., shows that the chariot-races then preceded the
                                    pentathlon, on the same day,—and must therefore have
                                    begun in the early morning.</p>
                                <p>The Pythian hippodrome was in the Crisaean plain (180 n.), near

                                    Pleistus opens upon a level tract. The site of Crisa, on a spur
                                    of Parnassus, overlooked it from the north, and Delphi from the

                                    ‘Achaean,’ as designating a man from a
                                    particular district, would naturally point to Phthiotis in
                                    southern Thessaly, where the subjects of Achilles
                                    ‘were called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and
                                    <title>Achaeans</title>’&lt;*&gt; <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 2.684" valid="yes">

                                    of <quote lang="greek">Ἀχαιΐη</quote> (7. 173) and <quote lang="greek">Ἀχαιοί</quote> (7. 197) in this
                                    sense,—meaning those whom in 7. 132 he calls <quote lang="greek">Ἀχαιοὶ οἱ Φθιῶται</quote>. But a poet who
                                    makes Orestes compete at the Pythian games against a Barcaean
                                    (727) was just as likely to use <quote lang="greek">Ἀχαιὸς</quote> in the local sense which it acquired after
                                    the Dorian conquest of Peloponnesus,—a man from
                                    ‘Achaia’ on the Corinthian Gulf. If this is
                                    (as I suppose) what he really meant, then we see how his mind
                                    worked in making this list; we have (1) two Peloponnesians; (2)
                                    then he goes south to Cyrenaica for two more competitors; and
                                    (3) the remaining six come from Northern Greece. </p>

                                    Orestes was entangled in the reins of all four. We may suppose,
                                    then, that, when the left wheel came off, the left tracehorse,
                                    plunging wildly, broke his traces, and freed himself. No mishap

                                    they broke the pole, they would still drag the disabled car.

                                    decision in any difference between himself and her brother, with
                                    whom he had formerly been at feud ( <bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 3.6.2" valid="yes">Apollod. 3. 6. 2</bibl>). When Polyneices sought Argive aid
                                    against Thebes, Amphiaraüs opposed the enterprise,
                                    foreseeing a fatal issue. Polyneices then bribed
                                    Eriphylè with a golden necklace, and she persuaded
                                    her husband to join the expedition. The Argives were routed by

                                    setting out for Thebes, the seer had charged him with this duty.
                                    Eriphylè, bribed once more, prevailed upon her son to

                                    in Arcadia, and there was purified. He was the subject of a play

                                    suggest <quote lang="greek">ἀχθῶν</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 204" valid="yes">cp. 204</bibl>
                                    <quote lang="greek">ἔκπαγλ’ ἄχθη</quote>). And <quote lang="greek">πολλῶν</quote>, as Hermann saw, is not likely
                                    to have been interpolated (‘<quote lang="greek">πολλῶν</quote>, si quidquam, sanum est’). For
                                    other conjectures, see Appendix.</p>
                                <p>The literal sense then is:—‘(I know this) by
                                    a life which, through all the months, is a turbid torrent of
                                    many things dread and horrible.’ <quote lang="greek">πανσύρτῳ</quote> seems rightly explained in one scholium
                                    as <quote lang="greek">πάντα σύροντι τὰ κακά</quote>:

                                    like <quote lang="greek">χαλκόπλακτος</quote> (484 n.), <quote lang="greek">ἀμφίπλακτος</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 688" valid="yes">

                                    join the genitive with <quote lang="greek">αἰῶνι</quote>,
                                    as=‘a life <emph>of</emph>’ (made up of)
                                    these things. For the verb <quote lang="greek">σύρω</quote> in

                                <p>This view gives <quote lang="greek">πανσύρτῳ</quote> a more
                                    forcible and more poetical sense than if it be taken
                                    as=‘swept together from every side.’ The
                                    meaning then would be, ‘a life, through all the
                                    months, of many dread horrors, <emph>accumulated</emph> from
                                    every quarter,’—the epithet <quote lang="greek">πανσύρτῳ</quote> being transferred from the
                                    troubles to the life itself. It would still, indeed, be possible
                                    to make <quote lang="greek">πανσύρτῳ</quote> active;

                                    harsher, on this interpretation, than on that which supposes the

                                    A lengthening of <quote lang="greek">α^</quote> before <quote lang="greek">θρ</quote>, though not impossible in lyrics
                                    (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 612" valid="yes">

                                    imperfect. In 850—852 Electra refers to the woes which
                                    she has so long endured. The Chorus now reply, ‘We

                                    mourning,’—‘the course of thy

                                    ἄν</lemma>. Elmsley (on Eur. <title>Med.</title> 416 f., p.
                                    151) remarked that the Attic poets seldom elide the <quote lang="greek">ε</quote> of the 3rd pers. sing. before <quote lang="greek">ἄν</quote>: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>
                                    <quote lang="greek">ἔγραψ’ ἄν</quote>,

                                    <emph>scripsisset.</emph> He does not add, however, that in
                                    respect to the weak (or ‘first’) aorists
                                    there was a reason for it, viz., that <quote lang="greek">ἔγραψ’ ἄν</quote>, when meant as the 3rd pers., was
                                    liable to be confused with the 1st, unless the context was
                                    decisive; a reason which did not apply to the strong aorists or
                                    imperfects, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> to <quote lang="greek">ἔλαθ’ ἄν</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἐλάνθαν’ ἄν</quote>. Yet, even in regard to the first
                                    aor., there is at least one instance where the MSS. attest the
                                    elision of <quote lang="greek">ε</quote>, and the sense confirms
                                    it; Ar. <title>Plut.</title> 1011 <quote lang="greek">ΓΡ...νηττάριον ἂν καὶ φάττιον ὑπεκορίζετο</quote>.

                                        <quote lang="greek">ᾔτησεν</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ᾔτησ’ ἂν</quote>, though not impossible,
                                    is improbable. Take, again, Eur. <title>Ion</title> 354 <quote lang="greek">σοὶ ταὐτὸν ἥβης, εἴπερ ἦν, εἶχ’ ἂν

                                <p>It is quite true that such elision was rare; the <quote lang="greek">ν ἐφελκυστικόν</quote> more usually averted
                                    it. The mistake is to deny that it was admissible. Porson's keen
                                    observation and fine instinct led him to no such rule; he found
                                    no offence (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) in Eur.

                                    required is: ‘Nor, if she had done it, would she have
                                    escaped notice.’ But the words <quote lang="greek">οὔτε δρῶσ’ ἐλάνθανεν</quote> could mean only one of
                                    two things: (1) ‘nor, when she did it, <emph>was she
                                        escaping</emph> (or <emph>used she to escape</emph>）
                                    notice’: (2) ‘nor, when she did it,
                                        <emph>was she in the way to escape</emph> notice’;

                                    That is: whichever shade of meaning were given to <quote lang="greek">ἐλάνθανεν</quote>, still <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δρῶσα</lemma>, in the absence of anything to

                                    apodosis. Conversely, before the simple <quote lang="greek">ἐλάνθανεν</quote> could have a conditional sense, we
                                    should require as protasis, not <quote lang="greek">δρῶσα</quote>, but <quote lang="greek">εἰ ἔδρα</quote>.</p>

                                        <quote lang="greek">με</quote> cause ambiguity. We may
                                    reply: (1) The mention of the murderer's name, which Electra has
                                    hitherto uttered only in her solitary lament (98), is forcible
                                    here; and the emphatic place given to it is in the manner of
                                    Sophocles (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1507" valid="yes">cp. 1507</bibl>

                                        γάρ σε κ.τ.λ.</quote> refer, of course, to the purpose
                                    which Electra now discloses—not to the guilt of
                                    Aegisthus. (3) The formal ambiguity of <quote lang="greek">σε..με</quote> is only such as occurs in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 288" valid="yes">
                                        <title>Ant.</title> 288</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἢ τοὺς
                                        κακοὺς τιμῶντας εἰσορᾷς θεούς</quote>;</p>
                                <p>In this play the fate of Aegisthus forms the climax. Electra has
                                    already said that Clytaemnestra shared in the murderous deed (97
                                    ff., 206), and has avowed that she would have wished Orestes to
                                    wreak vengeance on her (604). But she does not suggest that she
                                    herself or her sister should slay their mother; even the plur.
                                        <quote lang="greek">ἐχθροῖς</quote> in 979 need not mean
                                    more than Aegisthus. Sophocles avoids everything that could
                                    qualify our sympathy with Electra; while it suits the different
                                    aim of Euripides to make her plan the matricide. See
                                    Introduction. </p>

                                    ultimately saving his life, deprived him of funeral rites at

                                    her wish in 1131; but it represents a separate thought which
                                    rises in her mind as she pictures him perishing among strangers.</p>

                                <p> It is well to observe the delicately gradual process which leads
                                    up to the recognition.</p>
                                <p>(i) 1176—1187. She is surprised that <emph>her</emph>
                                    woes should affect the stranger, and he hints that they are his
                                    own. (ii) 1188 —1198. She is thus led to speak more in
                                    detail of her sorrows, and of her despair,—caused by
                                    her brother's death. (iii) 1199—1204. He once more
                                    expresses his pity,—and this time in words which cause
                                    her to ask whether he can be a <emph>kinsman.</emph> He does not
                                    give a direct answer, but inquires whether the Chorus are
                                    friendly, and is assured that they are so.</p>
                                <p>The preparation is now complete: the actual disclosure follows.
                                    (i) 1205— 1210. He asks her to give him the urn which
                                    is in her hands: she entreats that she may be allowed to keep
                                    it, and to pay it the last honours. (ii) 1211—1217. He
                                    tells her that she ought not to mourn for her brother.
                                    ‘Why,’ she asks: ‘if these are his
                                    ashes?’ ‘They are not so,’ he
                                    replies,—taking the urn from her hands. (iii)
                                    1218—1221. ‘Where, then,’ she
                                    asks, ‘is his grave?’ ‘The living
                                    have no grave.’ ‘He lives?’
                                    ‘Yes,—as surely as I live.’ </p>

                                <p> Bergk has an ingenious (though, I think, mistaken) theory
                                    concerning this passage. Seeing that v. 1180 resembles v. 1184,
                                    he suggests that 1180 was an inferior variant for 1184: and, on
                                    similar grounds, that 1183 was a feebler substitute for 1179.
                                    That is, there were two different texts of this passage.
                                        (<emph>a</emph>) In one of them, the better, verses 1180 and
                                    1183 were absent, and the rest stood in this order, 1178, 1181,
                                    1182, 1179, 1184. (<emph>b</emph>) In the other, verses 1179 and
                                    1184 were absent, and the rest stood in this order, 1178, 1181,
                                    1182, 1183, 1180. The present text arose from an attempt to
                                    harmonise the other two.</p>
                                <p>We have only to read the dialogue with attention to perceive that
                                    this hypothesis of variants is arbitrary. Verse 1183 expresses
                                    sympathy in a more definite and emphatic manner than v. 1179:
                                    verse 1184 expresses surprise more directly and decidedly than
                                    v. 1180. There is a gradual accentuation of the stranger's
                                    interest and of Electra's perplexity. This development is the
                                    internal proof that our text has not arisen from a dittographia. </p>

                                    which Sopho cles modelled his use of the act. here.

                                    said <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῖς

                                    have explained, indeed, why he should feel sympathy; but it
                                    would not have warranted the surmise that he was a kinsman. The
                                    objection that, with <quote lang="greek">τοῖσι σοῖς</quote>,
                                    v. 1201 merely repeats 1200, is un founded. He
                                    <emph>pities</emph> her woes, he says, because he

                                    κακόν</lemma>. Her sorrow—the long and bitter strife
                                    with her mother—is one over which, from its nature
                                        (<quote lang="greek">οἷον ἔφυ</quote>), no veil can be
                                    drawn; it is manifest to all, and fierce, like the sun in a
                                    cloudless summer sky. It is a sorrow which can never be done
                                    away with, <quote lang="greek">οὔ ποτε καταλύσιμον</quote>,
                                    because no reconciliation is possible. And it is one of which no
                                    time can efface the memory (<quote lang="greek">οὐδέ ποτε
                                        λησόμενον</quote>).</p>
                                <p>The author of the scholium on 1245 read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐνέβαλες</lemma>:—<quote lang="greek">ἐπείπερ ὑπέμνησεν αὐτὴν τῆς τοῦ πατρὸς
                                        ἀναιρέσεως, διὰ τῶν προειρημένων δύο στίχων φησὶν
                                        ὅτι ἐνέβαλές μοι κακὸν ἀνέφελον</quote>. This yields
                                    a good sense; ‘thou hast mentioned’
                                        (<emph>mentionem iniecisti</emph>). Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Rep. 344" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Rep.</title>

                                    explained in two ways. (1) ‘You have
                                    <emph>mentioned.</emph>’ For this sense there is no
                                    parallel. (2) ‘You have <emph>laid</emph> the burden
                                    of the woe <emph>upon</emph> me,’—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, ‘brought it to my
                                    recollection.’ This is perhaps just possible: but it
                                    is so artificial as to seem improbable. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑπέβαλες</lemma>, ‘you have
                                    suggested,’ would be an easy correction: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 833" valid="yes">cp. 833</bibl>
                                    <quote lang="greek">ὑποίσεις</quote>. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1170" valid="yes">

                                    original word, the corruption to <quote lang="greek">ἐπέβαλες</quote> is strange, since the sense would have been
                                    clear.</p>
                                <p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καταλύσιμον</lemma>, fitting
                                    here, as suggestive of <quote lang="greek">καταλύεσθαι

                                    forget</emph>,’ as Whitelaw renders. The <quote lang="greek">κακόν</quote> is half-personified here, though
                                    not in the preceding clauses; precisely as in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1167" valid="yes">

                                    (n.).</p>
                                <p>The usual explanation is, ‘that cannot <emph>be

                                    classical fut. pass. of <quote lang="greek">λανθάνω</quote>,
                                    for (<quote lang="greek">ἐπι</quote>）<quote lang="greek">λησθήσομαι</quote> occurs only in later Greek (LXX. <bibl default="NO" n="Pl. Ps. ix. 19" valid="yes"> Ps. ix. 19</bibl>, etc.). Even <quote lang="greek">λελήσεται</quote>=‘will

                                    cannot <emph>escape notice</emph>’; for, though the
                                    act. <quote lang="greek">λήσω</quote> is more usual in this
                                    sense ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 455" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Tr.</title>

                                    170), Arist. (<title>Pr. Anal.</title> 2. 19), Lucian, etc. But

                                    such a sense would evidently be too weak. </p>

                                    probable interpretation. Some have supposed the meaning to be
                                    that Electra ‘restrained her anger in
                                    silence,’ when Clyt. was exulting in the death of
                                    Orestes; but, in fact, her anger found a voice (see 792). Others
                                    understand that she ‘restrained her emotion’
                                    (of grief), on hearing the sad news; but she did not do so (see
                                    823—870): nor could <quote lang="greek">ὀργὰν</quote> mean ‘emotion’ in that
                                    sense.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand <quote lang="greek">ὀργή</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ὁρμή</quote> were easily confused in MSS.
                                    Thus in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 720" valid="yes">
                                        <title>Tr.</title> 720</bibl>, where <quote lang="greek">ὁρμῇ</quote> is right, <quote lang="greek">γ</quote> has
                                    been written over <quote lang="greek">μ</quote> in L, and <quote lang="greek">ὀργῇ</quote> is actually the reading of A,
                                    and of the Aldine. Cp. also <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 337." valid="yes">

                                <p>The context is the best guide to the sense which should be
                                    restored. Through out these lyrics, Orestes has been
                                    endeavouring to repress Electra's cries, lest she should be
                                    overheard (1236, 1238, 1251 f., 1257, 1259, 1271 f.). The
                                    corrupt words probably referred to this. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁρμὰν</lemma> is the
                                    ‘impulse’ or ‘emotion’
                                    which compelled her to utter her new joy. She turns to these
                                    sympathetic women, and excuses her incaution by her happiness.</p>

                                    156)</bibl> supposes an allusion to <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 300" valid="yes">Eur.
                                            <title>El.</title> 300—338</bibl>, where
                                    Electra, speaking to the disguised Orestes, mentions her own
                                    sufferings, her mother's splendours, and the insolence of
                                    Aegisthus. But such an allusion seems improbable: that speech is
                                    not long; it comes in with dramatic fitness; nor does it refer
                                    to the wasteful profusion of Aegisthus, which is the main point
                                    here. A later speech of Electra's in the same play (<bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 907" valid="yes">Eur. <title>El.</title>
                                    907—951</bibl>) would in some respects suit the words
                                    here better; but that is spoken over the corpse of Aegisthus,
                                    and could scarcely be regarded as delaying the action.</p>
                                <p>Another theory, that Sophocles alludes to the earlier part of the
                                        <title>Choephori</title>, is certainly mistaken. Possibly he
                                    had no particular work in view, but was merely glancing at a
                                    tendency which he had noticed in contemporary drama. </p>

                                <p> It has been held that these verses, or at least
                                    1340—1344, are spurious (cr. n.). Certainly Orestes
                                    has already heard from Electra that Clytaemnestra exults in the
                                    news of his death (1153—1156). Still, it is natural
                                    that he should make some reference (as he does in 1341) to his
                                    emissary's performance of the task. Not less natural is the
                                    question in 1343, since the old man, who entered the house at v.
                                    803, is the only person who can tell whether the feeling
                                    described by Electra still exists. </p>

                                    tribrach there is usu. a caesura both in the third and in the
                                    fourth foot (as <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 248" valid="yes">

                                    to the ear is like that of a tribrach in the first, rather than
                                    in the third, place of a trimeter. Hence we may defend the text
                                    here, and yet concede that no tragic poet could have written
                                    such a verse without the pause (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>

                                <p> A kommos. It falls into two principal parts. (1)
                                    1398—1421; the death of Clytaemnestra. (2)
                                    1422— 1441; Orestes and Pylades re-enter; Aegisthus
                                    approaches; and they prepare to receive him.</p>
                                <p>The general structure of this kommos is clearly strophic; but
                                    critics differ on details. The simplest view is that of Dindorf
                                    and others, that vv. 1398—1421 form a single
                                    strophe,=antistr. 1422— 1441. The lyric verses 1407,
                                    1413—4, and 1419—1421, correspond
                                    respectively with 1428, 1433—4, and
                                    1439—1441: for these, see Metrical Analysis. It is
                                    usually held, with Hermann, that the correspondence of the
                                    iambic trimeters also must be exact. This makes it necessary to
                                    assume a gap in our text after v. 1427 (n.), and a second after

                                <p>Others explain as follows. (1) Keeping both <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σε</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φθίνει φθίνει</lemma>: ‘fate is

                                    use of <quote lang="greek">φθίνειν</quote> is very small and
                                    doubtful: see Appendix. (2) Keeping <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σε</lemma>, but reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φθίνειν φθίνειν</lemma>: ‘now it

                                    fade.’ Both these versions force an impossible sense
                                    on <quote lang="greek">καθαμερία</quote>. That explanation of
                                    it was a mere makeshift of the scholiast; <quote lang="greek">ὦ γενεὰ τοῦ οἴκου τούτου, κατὰ ταύτην σε τὴν

                                <p>Nor is the objection to these interpretations merely verbal. They
                                    represent the Chorus as <emph>deploring</emph> that doom of the
                                    race which entails yet another deed of bloodshed. But, as
                                    Whitelaw well observes, this commits Sophocles to the Aeschylean
                                    view of the vengeance ‘as a new crime in the series of
                                    crimes’ (Translation, p. 437). The Chorus are in the
                                    fullest sympathy with the avengers. They regard the slaying of
                                    Clytaemnestra not as a new calamity, but as a welcome
                                    retribution: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1434" valid="yes">cp. 1434</bibl>

                                    deserves the favour which it has found with almost all editors
                                    from Hermann onwards. If <quote lang="greek">λέγειν</quote> be
                                    sound, the sense must be, ‘utterance fails
                                    me,’—at a moment so terrible. But <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἔχω λέγειν</quote> is not equivalent
                                    to <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἔχω φωνεῖν</quote>, nor, again,
                                    to <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἔχω τί λέγω</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">τί φῶ</quote>). It ought to mean rather,
                                    ‘nor can I <emph>describe</emph>’ (what I
                                    see): which would be strange here. Hermann suggested that <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἔχω λέγειν</quote> might be an
                                    unfinished sentence,—‘but I cannot
                                    tell..’ (whether the avengers have accomplished their
                                    deed). This, however, as he allows, would be frigid. So also
                                    would <quote lang="greek">ψέγειν</quote> be, if explained in
                                    his way (‘I cannot complain that they have not well
                                    dyed their swords’). Taken, however, in its natural
                                    sense, ‘nor can I blame the deed,’ <quote lang="greek">ψέγειν</quote> is forcible enough. In <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 989" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ch.</title> 989</bibl> the
                                    converse corruption took place, <quote lang="greek">λέγω</quote> becoming <quote lang="greek">ψέγω</quote>. </p>

                                    it can denote ‘descent upon’ in a purely
                                    figurative sense (<quote lang="greek">λεγειν κατά
                                    τινος</quote>). The peculiarity here is that, while the movement
                                    is literal, the descent is figurative. Even <quote lang="greek">κατὰ σκοποῦ τοξεύειν</quote> (Herodian 6. 7. 19) is
                                    different, since the arrow is conceived as describing a curve. I
                                    do not know any real paraliel for this use of <quote lang="greek">κατά</quote>. It seems to justify some
                                    suspicion of the text.</p>

                                    the eccyclema is pushed forward. This was a small and low stage.
                                    A corpse is seen upon it, the face and outlines concealed by a
                                    covering. Near it stand Orestes and Pylades—the
                                    ‘Phocians’ whom Aegisthus seeks. The
                                    eccyclema remains displayed to the end, and at v. 1507 Orestes
                                    and Pylades go out behind it. So in the <title>Antigone</title>
                                    the eccyclema is in view from 1293 to the close, and at 1347
                                    Creon is led off behind it.</p>

                                    If they are rejected, it must be on the ground that the thought
                                    which they express is inappropriate. But is it so? Aegisthus has

                                    to the working of the hereditary <quote lang="greek">ἀρά</quote>, and implies that it will be followed by other
