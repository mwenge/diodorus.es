By the fact of the guilt which has been brought home to him Oedipus is tacitly considered to have forfeited the throne.  His two sons being still young boys, their maternal uncle, Creon, succeeds to the direction of affairs.  The selfblinded Oedipus, in his first agony of horror and despair, beseeches Creon to send him away from Thebes.  Let him no longer pollute it by his presence: let him perish in the wilds of Cithaeron, as his parents would have had it.  Creon replies that he cannot assume the responsibility of acceding to the wish of Oedipus: the oracle at Delphi must be consulted.  If Apollo says that Oedipus is to be sent away from Thebes, then it shall be done.
</p>
<p>Sophocles supposes a long interval—some twenty years, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Events of the interval between the plays.</note> perhaps—between the two dramas of which Oedipus is the hero. As the exile himself says, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 395" valid="yes">395</bibl><quote lang="en">"'Tis little to uplift old age, when youth was ruined."</quote></cit> We have to make out the events of this interval, as best we can, from stray hints in the <title>Coloneus</title><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><p>The Greek title of the play is <title lang="greek">*oi)di/pous e)pi\ *kolwnw=|</title>,—the prep. meaning <emph>at</emph>, as in such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἐσχάρῃ</foreign> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 7.160" valid="yes"><title>Od.</title> 7.160</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ θύραις</foreign>, etc. It is cited by the authors of the Arguments as <title lang="greek">o( e)pi\ *kolwnw=| *oi)di/pous</title> (pp. 3 ff.). The earlier play was doubtless called simply <title lang="greek">*oi)di/pous</title> by Sophocles,—<foreign lang="greek">Τύραννος</foreign> having been a later addition (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. 4): but the second play required a distinguishing epithet, and the words <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ Κολωνῷ</foreign> must be ascribed to the poet himself. The traditional Latin title, <title lang="la">Oedipus Coloneus,</title> is from <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Sen. 7.21" valid="yes">Cic. <title>De Sen.</title> 7.21</bibl>, where it occurs in the accus., <title>Oedipum Coloneum.</title> Did Cicero intend <title>Coloneum</title> to represent <foreign lang="greek">Κολώνειον</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνέα</foreign>? In other words, ought we to pronounce <emph>Colonēüs</emph> or <emph>Colonēūs</emph>? 1. In favour of the former view, which seems much the more probable, we may observe two points. (i) In <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Fin. 5.1.3" valid="yes"><title>De Fin.</title> 5. 1 § 3</bibl> Cicero writes: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Fin. 5.1.3" valid="yes" /><quote lang="la">“Nam me ipsum huc modo venientem convertebat ad sese <emph>Coloneus ille locus</emph>, cuius incola Sophocles ob oculos obversabatur; quem scis quam admirer, quamque eo delecter.”</quote></cit> There, <foreign lang="la">locus Coloneus</foreign>, as a periphrasis for <foreign lang="la">Colonus</foreign>, represents <foreign lang="greek">τόπος Κολώνειος</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">τόπος Κολωνεύς</foreign>. (ii) <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνεύς</foreign> (properly, a demesman of Colonus, <title>Corp. Inscr.</title> 172. 42) would not have been appropriate in the title of this play, since it would have implied that Oedipus had been resident at Colonus. In the <title lang="greek">*glau=kos *potnieu/s</title> of Aeschylus (<bibl default="NO">Nauck, <title>Trag. Fragm.</title> 34-41</bibl>) Glaucus was supposed to have had a fixed abode at Potniae. On the other hand, <foreign lang="la">Coloneus</foreign>, as=<foreign lang="greek">Κολώνειος</foreign>, might well have been used by Cicero to express the same sense as <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ Κολωνῷ</foreign> (which would have been more closely rendered by <foreign lang="la">ad Colonum</foreign>),—"at Colonus," <q direct="unspecified" lang="en">connected with it.</q> The Greek adjectives in <foreign lang="greek">ειος</foreign> which Cicero transliterates usually answer to names of persons, not of places (as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Fin. 2.7.20" valid="yes"><title>De Fin.</title> 2. 7 § 20</bibl> <quote lang="la">Aristippeo</quote></cit>; <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Fin. 2.7.22" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> § 22</bibl> <quote lang="la">Epicurea</quote></cit>); but here he could hardly have used <foreign lang="la">Colonensis</foreign>, which would have suggested a native or inhabitant of the place.
</p>
<p>2. While decidedly preferring the view just stated, I must, however, also notice what can fairly be said in favour of the other view,—that by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> Cicero meant <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνέα</foreign>. (i) In <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Tusc. 5.12.34" valid="yes"><title>Tusc. Disp.</title> 5. 12 § 34</bibl> he has <foreign lang="la">Zeno Citieus</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">Κιτιεύς</foreign> (for which Gellius uses <foreign>Citiensis</foreign>): in <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Div. 2.42.88" valid="yes"><title>De Div.</title> 2. 42 § 88</bibl> <quote lang="la">Scylax Halicarnasseus</quote></cit>=<foreign lang="greek">Ἁλικαρνασσεύς</foreign> (for which Livy uses <foreign lang="la">Halicarnassensis</foreign>, and Tacitus <foreign lang="la">Halicarnassius</foreign>);—as similarly, he sometimes retains Greek forms in <foreign lang="greek">ίτης</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ιάτης</foreign> (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. N.D. 1.23.63" valid="yes"><title>De Nat.</title> 1. 23 § 63</bibl> <quote lang="la">Abderites Protagoras</quote></cit>:  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. N.D. 1.23.29" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> § 29</bibl> <quote lang="la">Diogenes Apolloniates</quote></cit>). Hence, the nomin. <title lang="la">Oedipus Coloneus</title>, if it had occurred in Cicero, might well have stood for <foreign lang="greek">Οἰδίπους Κολωνεύς</foreign>. (ii) With regard to the accus. of Latin adjectives taken from Greek forms in <foreign lang="greek">εύς</foreign>, cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Att. 7.3.10" valid="yes">Cic. <title>ad Att.</title> 3 § 10,</bibl> <quote lang="la">Venio ad Piraeea; in quo magis reprehendendus sum, quod homo Romanus <emph>Piraeea</emph> scripserim, non <emph>Piraeeum</emph> (sic enim omnes nostri locuti sunt).</quote></cit> It may, indeed, be said that, if he wrote <foreign lang="la">Piraeea</foreign>, he might also have ventured on <foreign lang="la">Colonea:</foreign> but more weight seems due to the other fact,—that, if he had represented <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνέα</foreign> by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> he would have been warranted by Roman usage. It is just possible, then, that by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> Cicero meant <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνέα</foreign>, though it seems much more likely that he meant <foreign lang="greek">Κολώνειον</foreign>. [The form <foreign lang="greek">Κολώνειος</foreign> does not seem to be actually extant in Greek. In the scholia on vv. 60, 65 of the play the men of Colonus are called <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνιᾶται</foreign>, probably a corruption of <foreign lang="greek">Κολωνῖται</foreign>. The latter term was applied by Hypereides to the artisans frequenting the Colonus Agoraeus (Pollux 7. 132), and is miswritten <foreign lang="greek">Κολωναῖται</foreign> in Harpocration.]</p></note>.
</p>
<p>The promise with which Creon pacified Oedipus at the end of the <title>Tyrannus</title> does not appear to have been fulfilled. The oracle was not consulted as to whether Oedipus should remain at Thebes. He remained there; and, as the lapse of time softened his anguish, the blind and discrowned sufferer learned to love the seclusion of the house in which he had once reigned so brilliantly. Creon continued to act as regent. But at last a change took place in the disposition of the Thebans, or at least <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Expulsion of Oedipus.</note>in Creon's. A feeling grew up that Thebes was harbouring a defilement, and it was decided to expel Oedipus. There is no  mention of an oracle as the cause; indeed, the idea of a divine mandate is incompatible with the tenor of the story, since Oedipus could not then have charged the whole blame on Thebes. One circumstance of his expulsion was bitter to him above all the rest. His two sons, who had now reached manhood, said not a word in arrest of his doom.
</p>
<p>But his two daughters were nobly loyal. Antigone went forth from Thebes with her blind father,—his sole attendant,— and thenceforth shared the privations of his lot, which could now be only that of a wandering mendicant. Ismene stayed at Thebes, but it was in order to watch the course of events there in her father's interest. We hear of one occasion, at least, on which she risked a secret journey for the purpose of acquainting him with certain oracles which had just been received. The incident marks the uneasy feeling with which the Thebans still regarded the blind exile, and their unwillingness that he should share such light on his own destiny as they could obtain from Apollo.
</p>
<p>Oedipus had now grown old in his destitute wanderings, when a sacred mission sent from Thebes to Delphi brought back an oracle concerning him which excited a lively interest in the minds of his former subjects. It was to the effect that the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The new oracle.</note> welfare of Thebes depended on Oedipus, not merely while he lived, but also after his death. The Thebans now conceived the desire of establishing Oedipus somewhere just beyond their border. In this way they thought that they would have him under their control, while at the same time they would avoid the humiliation of confessing themselves wrong, and receiving him back to dwell among them. Their main object was that, on his death, they might secure the guardianship of his grave.
</p>
<p>The new oracle obviously made an opportunity for the sons of Oedipus at Thebes, if they were true to their banished father. They could urge that Apollo, by this latest utterance, had condoned any pollution that might still be supposed to attach to the person of Oedipus, and had virtually authorised his recall to his ancient realm. Thebes could not be defiled by the presence of a man whom the god had declared to be the arbiter of its fortunes.
</p>
<p>Unhappily, the sons—Polyneices and Eteocles—were no longer in a mood to hear the dictates of filial piety. When they had first reached manhood, they had been oppressed by a sense of the curse on their family, and the taint on their own birth. They had wished to spare Thebes the contamination of their rule; they had been desirous that the regent,—their uncle Creon,—should become king. But presently,—<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 371" valid="yes">371</bibl><quote lang="en">"moved by some god, and by a sinful mind,"</quote></cit>—compelled by the inexorable Fury of their house,—they renounced these intentions of wise selfdenial. Not only were they fired with the passion for power, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The strife between the sons.</note>but they fell to striving with each other for the sole power. Eteocles, the younger<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See <ref targOrder="U" target="cl375">note on v. 375</ref>.</note> brother, managed to win over the citizens. The elder brother, Polyneices, was driven out of Thebes. He went to Argos, where he married the daughter of king Adrastus. All the most renowned warriors of the Peloponnesus became his allies, and he made ready to lead a great host against Thebes. But, while the mightiest chieftains were marshalling their followers in his cause, the voices of prophecy warned him that the issue of his mortal feud depended on the blind and aged beggar whom, years before, he had coldly seen thrust out from house and home. That side would prevail which Oedipus should join.

<span class="line-ref">Line 2</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play.</note></p>
<p>This is the moment at which our play begins. The action falls into six principal divisions or chapters, marked off, as usual, by choral lyrics.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">I. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1" valid="yes">Prologue: 1-116</bibl>.</note>The scene, which remains the same throughout the play, is at Colonus, about a mile and a quarter north-west of Athens. We are in front of a grove sacred to the Furies,—here worshipped under a propitiatory name, as the Eumenides or Kindly Powers. While the snow still lingers on distant hills (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1060" valid="yes">v. 1060</bibl>), the song of many nightingales is already heard from the thick covert of this grove in the Attic plain; we seem to breathe the air of a bright, calm day at the beginning of April<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The dates of the nightingale's arrival in Attica, for the years indicated, are thus given by Dr Krüper, the best authority on the birds of Greece (<bibl default="NO"><title lang="de">Griechische Jahrzeiten</title> for 1875, Heft III., p. 243</bibl>):—<date authname="1867-03-29" value="1867-03-29">March 29 (1867)</date>, <date authname="1873-04-13" value="1873-04-13">April 13 (1873)</date>, <date authname="1874-04-06" value="1874-04-06">April 6 (1874)</date>. The dates for several other localities in the Hellenic countries (Acarnania— Parnassus—Thessalonica—Olympia—Smyrna), as recorded by the same observer for two years in each case, all range between March 27 and April 15. For this reference I am indebted to Professor Alfred Newton, F.R.S., of Cambridge. The male birds (who alone sing) arrive some days before the females, as is usually the case with migratory birds, and sing as soon as they come. Thus it is interesting to notice that the period of the year at which the nightingale's song would first be heard in Attica coincides closely with the celebration of the Great Dionysia, in the last days of March and the first days of April (<bibl default="NO">C. Hermann <title>Gr. Ant.</title> II. 59. 6</bibl>). If the play was produced at that festival, the allusions to the nightingale (vv. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 18" valid="yes">18</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 671" valid="yes">671</bibl>) would have been felt as specially appropriate to the season.</note>.  The blind Oedipus, led by Antigone, enters on the left hand of the spectator. He is in the squalid garb of a beggar-man,— carrying a wallet, wherein to put alms (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1262" valid="yes">v. 1262</bibl>); the wind plays with his unkempt white hair; the wounds by which, in the prime of manhood, he had destroyed his sight, have left ghastly traces on the worn face; but there is a certain nobleness in his look and bearing which tempers the beholder's sense of pity or repulsion. The old man is tired with a long day's journey; they have heard from people whom they met on the way that they are near Athens, but they do not know the name of the spot at which they have halted. Antigone seats her father on a rock which is just within the limits of the sacred grove. As she is about to go in search of information, a man belonging to Colonus appears. Oedipus is beginning to accost him, when the stranger cuts his words short by a peremptory command to come off the sacred ground. "To whom is it sacred?" Oedipus asks. To the Eumenides, is the reply. On hearing that name, Oedipus invokes the grace of those goddesses, and declares that he will never leave the rest which he has found. He begs the stranger to summon Theseus, the king of Athens, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 72" valid="yes">72</bibl><quote lang="en">"that by a small service he may find a great gain."</quote></cit> The stranger, who is struck by the noble mien of the blind old man, says that he will go and consult the people of Colonus; and meanwhile he tells Oedipus to stay where he is.
</p>
<p>Left alone with Antigone, Oedipus utters a solemn and very beautiful prayer to the Eumenides, which discloses the motive of his refusal to leave the sacred ground. In his early manhood, when he inquired at Delphi concerning his parentage, Apollo predicted the calamities which awaited him; but also promised  him rest, so soon as he should reach <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 89" valid="yes">89</bibl><quote lang="en">"<emph>a seat of the Awful Goddesses.</emph>"</quote></cit> There he should close his troubled life; and along with the release, he should have this reward,—power to benefit the folk who sheltered him, and to hurt the folk who had cast him out. And when his end was near, there should be a sign from the sky. Apollo and the Eumenides themselves have led him to this grove: he prays the goddesses to receive him, and to give him peace.
</p>
<p>Hardly has his prayer been spoken, when Antigone hears footsteps approaching, and retires with her father into the covert of the grove.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 117" valid="yes">117-253</bibl>.</note>The elders of Colonus, who form the Chorus, now enter the orchestra. They have heard that a wanderer has entered the grove, and are in eager search for the perpetrator of so daring an impiety. Oedipus, led by Antigone, suddenly discovers himself. His appearance is greeted with a cry of horror from the Chorus; but horror gradually yields to pity for his blindness, his age, and his misery. They insist, however, on his coming out of the sacred grove. If he is to speak to them, it must be on lawful ground. Before he consents, he exacts a pledge that he shall not be removed from the ground outside of the grove. They promise this. Antigone then guides him to a seat beyond the sacred precinct. The Chorus now ask him who he is. He implores them to spare the question; but their curiosity has been aroused. They extort an answer. No sooner has the name OEDIPUS passed his lips, than his voice is drowned in a shout of execration. They call upon him to leave Attica instantly. He won their promise by a fraud, and it is void. They refuse to hear him. Antigone makes an imploring appeal.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 254" valid="yes">254-667</bibl>.</note>In answer to her appeal, the Chorus say that they pity both father and daughter, but fear the gods still more; the wanderers must go.
</p>
<p>Oedipus now speaks with powerful eloquence, tinged at first with bitter scorn. Is this the traditional compassion of Athens for the oppressed? They have lured him from his sanctuary, and now they are driving him out of their country,—for fear of what? Simply of his name. He is free from moral guilt. He  brings a blessing for Athens. What it is, he will reveal when their king arrives.—The Chorus agree to await the decision of Theseus. He will come speedily, they are sure, when he hears the name of Oedipus.
</p>
<p>At this moment, Antigone descries the approach of her sister Ismene, who has come from Thebes with tidings for her father. Ismene tells him of the fierce strife which has broken out between her brothers,—and how Polyneices has gone to Argos. Then she mentions the new oracle which the Thebans have just received,—that their welfare depends on him, in life and death. Creon will soon come, she adds, in the hope of enticing him back.
</p>
<p>Oedipus asks whether <emph>his sons</emph> knew of this oracle. "Yes," she reluctantly answers. At that answer, the measure of his bitterness is full: he breaks into a prayer that the gods may hear him, and make this new strife fatal to both brothers alike. And then, turning to the Chorus, he assures them that he is destined to be a deliverer of Attica: for his mind is now made up; he has no longer any doubt where his blessing, or his curse, is to descend. The Chorus, in reply, instruct him how a proper atonement may be made to the Eumenides for his trespass on their precinct; and Ismene goes to perform the prescribed rites in a more distant part of the grove.
</p>
<p>Here follows a lyric dialogue between the Chorus and <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 510" valid="yes">510-548</bibl>.)</note> Oedipus. They question him on his past deeds, and he pathetically asserts his moral innocence.
</p>
<p>Theseus now enters, on the spectator's right hand, as coming from Athens. Addressing Oedipus as "son of Laïus," he assures him, with generous courtesy, of protection and sympathy; he has himself known what it is to be an exile. Oedipus explains his desire. He craves to be protected in Attica while he lives, and to be buried there when he is dead. He has certain benefits to bestow in return; but these will not be felt until after his decease. He fears that his sons will seek to remove him to Thebes. If Theseus promises to protect him, it must be at the risk of a struggle. Theseus gives the promise. He publicly adopts Oedipus as a citizen. He then leaves the scene.
</p>
<p>Oedipus having now been formally placed under the protection<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 668" valid="yes">668-719</bibl>.</note> of Athens, the Chorus appropriately celebrate the land  which has become his home. Beginning with Colonus, they pass to themes of honour for Attica at large,—the olive, created by Athena and guarded by Zeus,—the horses and horsemanship of the land, gifts of Poseidon,—and his other gift, the empire of the sea. Of all the choral songs in extant Greek drama, this short ode is perhaps the most widely famous; a distinction partly due, no doubt, to the charm of the subject, and especially to the manifest glow of a personal sentiment in the verses which describe Colonus; but, apart from this, the intrinsic poetical beauty is of the highest and rarest order<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Dr Heinrich Schmidt, in his <title>Compositionslehre</title>, has selected this First Stasimon as a typical masterpiece of ancient choral composition, and has shown by a thorough analysis (<bibl default="NO">pp. 428-432</bibl>) how perfect is the construction, alike from a metrical and from a properly lyric or musical point of view. <quote lang="de">Da ist keine einzige Note unnütz,</quote> he concludes; <quote lang="de">jeder Vers, jeder Satz, jeder Takt in dem schönsten rhythmischen Connexe.</quote></note>.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 720" valid="yes">720-1043</bibl>.</note>As the choral praises cease, Antigone exclaims that the moment has come for proving that Athens deserves them. Creon enters, with an escort of guards.
</p>
<p>His speech, addressed at first to the Chorus, is short, and skilfully conceived. They will not suppose that an old man like himself has been sent to commit an act of violence against a powerful State. No; he comes on behalf of Thebes, to plead with his aged kinsman, whose present wandering life is truly painful for everybody concerned. The honour of the city and of the family is involved. Oedipus should express his gratitude to Athens, and then return to a decent privacy <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 777" valid="yes">777</bibl><quote lang="en">"in the house of his fathers."</quote></cit>
</p>
<p>With a burst of scathing indignation, Oedipus replies. They want him now; but they thrust him out when he was longing to stay. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 777" valid="yes">777</bibl><quote lang="en">"In the house of his fathers!"</quote></cit> No, that is not their design. They intend to plant him somewhere just beyond their border, for their own purposes. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 787" valid="yes">787</bibl><quote lang="en">"That portion is not for thee,"</quote></cit> he tells Creon, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 788" valid="yes">788</bibl><quote lang="en">"but this,—my curse upon your land, ever abiding therein;—and for my sons, this heritage—room enough in my realm, wherein — to die."</quote> </cit>
</p>
<p>Failing to move him, Creon drops the semblance of persuasion. He bluntly announces that he already holds one hostage;  —Ismene, who had gone to perform the rites in the grove, has been captured by his guards;—and he will soon have a second. He lays his hand upon Antigone. Another moment, and his attendants drag her from the scene. He is himself on the point of seizing Oedipus, when Theseus enters,—having been startled by the outcry, while engaged in a sacrifice at the neighbouring altar of Poseidon.
</p>
<p>On hearing what has happened, Theseus first sends a message to Poseidon's altar, directing the Athenians who were present at the sacrifice to start in pursuit of Creon's guards and the captured maidens.—Then, turning to Creon, he upbraids him with his lawless act, and tells him that he shall not leave Attica until the maidens are restored. Creon, with ready effrontery, replies that, in attempting to remove a polluted wretch from Attic soil, he was only doing what the Areiopagus itself would have wished to do; if his manner was somewhat rough, the violence of Oedipus was a provocation. This speech draws from Oedipus an eloquent vindication of his life, which is more than a mere repetition of the defence which he had already made to the Chorus. Here he brings out with vivid force the helplessness of man against fate, and the hypocrisy of his accuser.—Theseus now calls on Creon to lead the way, and show him where the captured maidens are,—adding a hint, characteristically Greek, that no help from Attic accomplices shall avail him. Creon sulkily submits,—with a muttered menace of what he will do when he reaches home. <foreign lang="la">Exeunt</foreign> Theseus and his attendants, with Creon, on the spectator's left.
</p>
<p>The Chorus imagine themselves at the scene of the coming <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1044" valid="yes">1044-1095</bibl>.</note> fray, and predict the speedy triumph of the rescuers,—invoking the gods of the land to help. A beautiful trait of this ode is the reference to the <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1049" valid="yes">1049</bibl><quote lang="en">"torch-lit strand"</quote></cit> of Eleusis, and to the mysteries which the initiated poet held in devout reverence.
</p>
<p>At the close of their chant, the Chorus give Oedipus the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1096" valid="yes">1096-1210</bibl>.</note> welcome news that they see his daughters approaching, escorted by Theseus and his followers. The first words of Antigone to her blind father express the wish that some wonder-working god could enable him to see their brave deliverer; and then, with much truth to nature, father and daughters are allowed to  forget for a while that anyone else is present. When at last Oedipus turns to thank Theseus, his words are eminently noble, and also touching. His impulse is to salute his benefactor by kissing his cheek, but it is quickly checked by the thought that this is not for him; no, nor can he permit it, if Theseus would. The line drawn by fate, the line which parts him and his from human fellowship, is rendered only more sacred by gratitude.
</p>
<p>At this point we may note, in passing, a detail of dramatic economy. The story of the rescue would have been material for a brilliant speech, either by Theseus, or, before his entrance, by a messenger. But the poet's sense of fitness would not allow him to adorn an accident of the plot at the cost of curtailing an essential part,—viz., the later scene with Polyneices, which must have been greatly abridged if a narrative had been admitted here. So, when Antigone is questioned by her father as to the circumstances of the rescue, she refers him to Theseus; and Theseus says that it is needless for <emph>him</emph> to vaunt his own deeds, since Oedipus can hear them at leisure from his daughters.
</p>
<p>There is a matter, Theseus adds, on which he should like to consult Oedipus. A stranger, it seems, has placed himself as a suppliant at the altar of Poseidon. This happened while they were all away at the rescue, and no one knows anything about the man. He is not from Thebes, but he declares that he is a kinsman of Oedipus, and prays for a few words with him. It is only guessed whence he comes; can Oedipus have any relations at Argos? Oedipus remembers what Ismene told him; he knows who it is; and he implores Theseus to spare him the torture of hearing <emph>that</emph> voice. But Antigone's entreaties prevail. Theseus leaves the scene, in order to let the suppliant know that the interview will be granted.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1211" valid="yes">1211-1248</bibl>.</note>The choral ode which fills the pause glances forward rather than backward, though it is suggested by the presage of some new vexation for Oedipus. It serves to turn our thoughts towards the approaching end.—Not to be born is best of all; the next best thing is to die as soon as possible. And the extreme of folly is the desire to outlive life's joys. Behold yon aged and afflicted stranger,—lashed by the waves of trouble from east and  west, from south and north! But there is one deliverer, who come to all at last.
</p>
<p>Polyneices now enters,—not attended, like Creon, by guards, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1249" valid="yes">1249-1555</bibl>.</note> but alone. He is shedding tears; he begins by uttering the deepest pity for his father's plight, and the bitterest selfreproach.—Oedipus, with averted head, makes no reply.— Polyneices appeals to his sisters; will they plead for him? Antigone advises him to state in his own words the object of his visit.—Then Polyneices sets forth his petition. His Argive allies are already gathered before Thebes. He has come as a suppliant to Oedipus, for himself, and for his friends too. Oracles say that victory will be with the side for which Oedipus may declare. Eteocles, in his pride at Thebes, is mocking father and brother alike. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1340" valid="yes">1340</bibl><quote lang="en">"If thou assist me, I will soon scatter his power, and will stablish thee in thine own house, and stablish myself, when I have cast him out by force."</quote></cit>
</p>
<p>Oedipus now breaks silence; but it is in order to let the <emph>Chorus</emph> know why he does so. His son, he reminds them, has been sent to them by their king.—Then, suddenly turning on Polyneices, he delivers an appalling curse, dooming both his sons to die at Thebes by each other's hands. In concentrated force of tragic passion this passage has few rivals. The great scene is closed by a short dialogue between Polyneices and his elder sister,—one of the delicate links between this play and the poet's earlier <title>Antigone</title>.  She implores him to abandon his fatal enterprise. But he is not to be dissuaded; he only asks that, if he falls, she and Ismene will give him burial rites; he disengages himself from their embrace, and goes forth, under the shadow of the curse.
</p>
<p>A lyric passage now follows, which affords a moment of <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1447" valid="yes">1447-1499</bibl>.)</note> relief to the strained feelings of the spectators, and also serves (like a similar passage before, vv. 510—548) to separate the two principal situations comprised in this chapter of the drama.— The Chorus are commenting on the dread doom which they have just heard pronounced, when they are startled by the sound of thunder. As peal follows peal, and lightnings glare from the darkened sky, the terror-stricken elders of Colonus utter broken prayers to averting gods. But for Oedipus the  storm has another meaning; it has filled him with a strange eagerness. He prays Antigone to summon Theseus.
</p>
<p>As Theseus had left the scene in order to communicate with the suppliant at Poseidon's altar, no breach of probability is involved in his timely re-appearance. Oedipus announces that, by sure signs, he knows his hour to have come. Unaided by human hand, he will now show the way to the spot where his life must be closed. When he arrives there, to Theseus alone will be revealed the place appointed for his grave. At the approach of death, Theseus shall impart the secret to his heir alone; and, so, from age to age, that sacred knowledge shall descend in the line of the Attic kings. While the secret is religiously guarded, the grave of Oedipus shall protect Attica against invading foemen; Thebes shall be powerless to harm her.—<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1540" valid="yes">1540</bibl><quote lang="en">"And now let us set forth, for the divine summons urges me."</quote></cit> As Oedipus utters these words, Theseus and his daughters become aware of a change; the blind eyes are still dark, but the moral conditions of blindness have been annulled; no sense of dependence remains, no trace of hesitation or timidity; like one inspired, the blind man eagerly beckons them on; and so, followed by them, he finally passes from the view of the spectators.
</p>
<p>This final exit of Oedipus is magnificently conceived. As the idea of a spiritual illumination is one which pervades the play, so it is fitting that, in the last moment of his presence with us, the inward vision should be manifested in its highest clearness and power. It is needless to point out what a splendid opportunity this scene would give to an actor,—in the modern theatre not less than in the ancient. It shows the genius of a great poet combined with that instinct for dramatic climax which is seldom unerring unless guided by a practical knowledge of the stage.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1556" valid="yes">1556-1578</bibl>.</note>The elders of Colonus are now alone; they have looked their last on Oedipus; and they know that the time of his end has come. The strain of their chant is in harmony with this moment of suspense and stillness. It is a choral litany for the soul which is passing from earth. May the Powers of the unseen world be gracious; may no dread apparition vex the path to the fields below.
</p>
<p>A Messenger, one of the attendants of Theseus, relates what <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Exodos:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1579" valid="yes">1579-1779</bibl>.</note> befell after Oedipus, followed by his daughters and the king, arrived at the spot where he was destined to depart. Theseus was then left alone with him, and to Theseus alone of mortals the manner of his passing is known.
</p>
<p>The daughters enter. After the first utterances of grief, one <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1670" valid="yes">1670-1750</bibl>.)</note> feeling is seen to be foremost in Antigone's mind,—the longing to see her father's grave. She cannot bear the thought that it should lack a tribute from her hands. Ismene vainly represents that their father's own command makes such a wish unlawful,— impossible. Theseus arrives, and to him Antigone urges her desire. In gentle and solemn words he reminds her of the pledge which he had given to Oedipus. She acquiesces; and now prays that she and Ismene may be sent to Thebes: perhaps they may yet be in time to avert death from their brothers. Theseus consents; and the elders of Colonus say farewell to the Theban maidens in words which speak of submission to the gods:  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

At the moment of discovery he can feel nothing but the double stain: he cries out that <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1345" valid="yes">OT 1345</bibl><quote lang="en">"he has become most hateful to the gods."</quote></cit> He has, indeed, broken divine laws, and the divine Power has punished him by bringing his deeds to light. This Power does not, in the first instance, regard the intention, but the fact. It does not matter that his unconscious sins were due to the agency of an inherited curse, and that he is morally innocent. He has sinned, and he must suffer.
</p>
<p>In the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> we meet with this man again, after the lapse of several years. In a religious aspect he still rests under the stain, and he knows this. But, in the course of time, he has mentally risen to a point of view from which he can survey his own past more clearly. Consciousness of the stain is now subordinate to another feeling, which in his first despair had not availed to console him. He has gained a firm grasp, not to be lost, on the fact of his moral innocence. He remembers the  word of Apollo long ago, which coupled the prediction of his woes with a promise of final rest and reward; and he believes that his moral innocence is recognised by the Power which punished him. Thinking, then, on the two great facts of his life, his defilement and his innocence, he has come to look upon himself as neither pure nor yet guilty, but as a person set apart by the gods to illustrate their will,—as sacred. Hence that apparently strange contrast which belongs to the heart of the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> He declines to pollute his benefactor, Theseus, by his touch,—describing himself as one with whom <cit><quote lang="en">"all stain of sin hath made its dwelling"</quote><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1133" valid="yes"> (1133)</bibl></cit>. Yet, with equal truth and sincerity, he can assure the Athenians that he has come to them <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 287" valid="yes">287</bibl><quote lang="en">"as one sacred and pious,"</quote></cit>—the suppliant of the Eumenides, the disciple of Apollo (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 287" valid="yes">287</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, when the king pronounces a ban on the unknown murderer of Laïus, he charges his subjects that no one shall make that man <cit><quote lang="en">"partner of his prayer or sacrifice, or serve him with the lustral rite"</quote><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 239" valid="yes">(239 f.)</bibl></cit>. Ceremonial purity thus becomes a prominent idea at an early point in the <title>Tyrannus</title>;  and rightly so; for that play turns on acts as such. In the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> we have a description of the ritual to be observed in the grove of the Eumenides; but, as if to mark the difference of spirit between the two plays, it is followed by the striking words of Oedipus, when he suggests that a daughter shall officiate in his stead:—<cit><quote lang="en">"I think that one soul suffices to pay this debt for ten thousand, if it come with good-will to the shrine"</quote><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 497" valid="yes">(497)</bibl></cit>. When eternal laws are broken by men, the gods punish the breach, whether wilful or involuntary; but their ultimate judgment depends on the intent. That thought is dominant in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> The contrast between physical blindness and inward vision is an under-note, in harmony with the higher distinction between the form of conduct and its spirit.

<span class="line-ref">Line 4</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Oedipus of this play.</note></p>
<p>The Oedipus whom we find at Colonus utters not a word of self-reproach, except on one point; he regrets the excess of the former self-reproach which stung him into blinding himself. He has done nothing else that calls for repentance; he has been the passive instrument of destiny. It would be a mistake to  aim at bringing the play more into harmony with modern sentiment by suffusing it in a mild and almost Christian radiance, as though Oedipus had been softened, chastened, morally purified by suffering. Suffering has, indeed, taught him endurance (<foreign lang="greek">στέργειν</foreign>), and some degree of caution; he is also exalted in mind by a new sense of power; but he has not been softened. Anger, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 855" valid="yes">(855)</bibl><quote lang="en">"which was ever his bane"</quote></cit>, blazes up in him as fiercely as ever; Creon rebukes him for it; his friends are only too painfully conscious of it. The unrestrained anger of an old man may easily be a very pitiful and deplorable spectacle; in order to be that, it need only be lost to justice and to generosity, to reason and to taste; but it requires the touch of a powerful dramatist to deal successfully with a subject so dangerously near to comedy, and to make a choleric old man tragic; Shakspeare has done it, with pathos of incomparable grasp and range; Sophocles, in a more limited way, has done it too. Throughout the scene with Polyneices there is a malign sublimity in the anger of the aged Oedipus; it is profoundly in the spirit of the antique, and we imply a different standard if we condemn it as vindictive. The Erinys has no mercy for sins against kindred; the man cannot pardon, because the Erinys acts through him. Oedipus at Colonus is a sacred person, but this character depends on his relation to the gods, and not on any inward holiness developed in him by a discipline of pain. Probably the chief danger which the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> runs with modern readers is from the sense of repulsion apt to be excited by this inexorable resentment of Oedipus towards his sons. It is not so when Lear cries—

<quote lang="en"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="blankverse"><l>No, you unnatural hags,</l>
<l>I will have such revenges on you both,</l>
<l>That all the world shall—I will do such things,—</l>
<l>What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be</l>
<l>The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;</l>
<l>No, I'll not weep.</l></lg></quote>
</p>
<p>Sophocles has left it possible for <emph>us</emph> to abhor the implacable father more than the heartless children. The ancient Greek spectator, however, would have been less likely to experience such a revulsion of sympathy. Nearer to the conditions imagined,  he would more quickly feel all that was implied in the attitude of the sons at the moment when Oedipus was expelled from Thebes; his religious sense would demand a nemesis, while his ethical code would not require forgiveness of wrongs; and, lastly, he would feel that the implacability of Oedipus was itself a manifestation of the Fury which pursued the house.

The gods, who have vexed Oedipus from youth to age, make this amend to him,—that just before his death he is recognised by men as a mysteriously sacred person, who has the power to bequeath a blessing and a malison. They further provide that his departure out of his wretched life shall be painless, and such as to distinguish him from other men. But their attitude towards him is not that of a Providence which chastises men in love, for their good. They are the inscrutable powers who have had their will of a mortal. If such honour as they concede to him at the last is indeed the completion of a kindly purpose, it is announced only as the end of an arbitrary doom. If it is the crown of a salutary, though bitter, education, it appears only as the final justice (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1567" valid="yes">1567</bibl>) prescribed by a divine sense of measure. In the foreground of the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> a weary wanderer is arriving at his goal; but the drama is only half appreciated if we neglect the action which occupies the background. While the old man finds rest, the hereditary curse on his family continues its work. At the very moment when he passes away, the Fury is busy with his sons. The total impression made by the play as a work of art depends essentially on the manner in which the scene of sacred peace at Colonus is brought into relief against the dark fortunes of Polyneices and Eteocles.

<span class="line-ref">Line 6</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The curse on the sons.</note></p>
<p>Here it becomes important to notice an innovation made by Sophocles. In the epic version of the story, as also in the versions adopted by Aeschylus and Euripides, Oedipus cursed his sons at Thebes, before the strife had broken out between them.<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, pp. xvi and xix.</note> He doomed them to divide their heritage with the sword.  Their subsequent quarrel was the direct consequence of their father's curse. But, according to Sophocles, the curse had nothing to do with the quarrel. The strife which broke out between the sons was inspired by the evil genius of their race, and by their own sinful thoughts<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See vv. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 371" valid="yes">371</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 421" valid="yes">421</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1299" valid="yes">1299</bibl>.</note>. At that time Oedipus had uttered no imprecation. His curse was pronounced, <emph>after</emph> the breach between them, because they had preferred their selfish ambitions to the opportunity of recalling their father <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 421" valid="yes">(421)</bibl><note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1375">note on v. 1375</ref>.</note>. Long before, when he was driven from Thebes <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 441" valid="yes">(441)</bibl>, he had felt their apathy to be heartless; but he had uttered no curse then. There is a twofold dramatic advantage in the modification thus introduced by Sophocles. First, the two sons no longer appear as helpless victims of fate; they have incurred moral blame, and are just objects of the paternal anger. Secondly, when Polyneices—on the eve of combat with his brother—appeals to Oedipus, the outraged father still holds the weapon with which to smite him. The curse descends at the supreme crisis, and with more terrible effect because it has been delayed.

<span class="line-ref">Line 7</span><p>The secondary persons, like the hero, are best interpreted <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The other characters.</note> by the play itself; but one or two traits may be briefly noticed. The two scenes in which the removal of Oedipus is attempted are contrasted not merely in outward circumstance—Creon relying on armed force, while Polyneices is a solitary suppliant—but also in regard to the characters of the two visitors. It is idle to look for the Creon of the <title>Tyrannus</title> in the Creon of the <title>Coloneus:</title> they are different men, and Sophocles has not cared to preserve even a semblance of identity. The Creon of the <title>Tyrannus</title> is marked by strong self-respect, and is essentially kind-hearted, though undemonstrative; the Creon of this play is a heartless and hypocritical villain. A well-meaning but wrongheaded martinet, such as the Creon of the <title>Antigone</title>, is a conceivable development of the <title>Tyrannus</title> Creon, but at least stands on a much higher level than the Creon of the <title>Coloneus.</title> Polyneices is cold-hearted, selfish, and of somewhat coarse fibre, but he is sincere and straightforward; in the conversation with  Antigone he evinces real dignity and fortitude. In the part of Theseus, which might so easily have been commonplace, Sophocles has shown a fine touch; this typical Athenian is more than a walking king; he is a soldier bred in the school of adversity, loyal to gods and men, perfect in courtesy, but stern at need. Comparing the representation of the two sisters in the <title>Antigone</title> with that given in this play, we may remark the tact with which the poet has abstained here from tingeing the character of Ismene with anything like selfish timidity. At the end of the play, where the more passionate nature of the heroic Antigone manifests itself, Ismene is the sister whose calm common-sense is not overpowered by grief; but she grieves sincerely and remains, as she has been throughout, entirely loyal.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Attitude of the Chorus.</note>A word should be added on the conduct of the Chorus in regard to Oedipus. Before they know who he is, they regard him with horror as the man who has profaned the grove; but their feeling quickly changes to compassion on perceiving that he is blind, aged, and miserable. Then they learn his name, and wish to expel him because they conceive his presence to be a defilement. They next relent, not simply because he says that he brings benefits for Athens,—though they take account of that fact, which is itself a proof that he is at peace with the gods,—but primarily because he is able to assure them that he is <cit><quote lang="en">"sacred and pious"</quote><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 8</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Oedipus-myth at Colonus.</note></p>
<p>The connection of Oedipus with Colonus was no invention of Sophocles. He found the local legend existing, and only gave it such a form as should harmonise it with his own treatment of the first chapter in the Oedipus-myth. It is unnecessary to suppose that, when he composed the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, he contemplated an <title>Oedipus at Colonus.</title> As a drama, the former is complete in itself; it is only as an expression of the myth that it is supplemented by the latter.
</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, should the King of Thebes have been connected by an ancient legend with this particular place in Attica? The primary link was a cult of the Eumenides at Colonus, which must have been still older than the association of Oedipus with that spot. This cult was itself connected, as the play indicates, with the existence at or near Colonus of a rift or cavernous opening in the ground, supposed to communicate with the under-world. The worship of the Eumenides at Colonus was identical in spirit with their worship at the Areiopagus, where a similar "descent to Hades" was the physical origin. The ancient rigour which required that bloodshed, whether deliberate or not, should be expiated by blood, was expressed by the older idea of the Erinyes, the implacable pursuers. The metamorphosis of the Erinyes into the Eumenides corresponds with a later and milder sense that bloodshed is compatible with varying degrees of guilt, ranging from premeditated murder to homicide in self-defence or by accident. Athenian legend claimed that this transformation of the Avengers took place in Attica, and that the institution of the court on the Areiopagus marked the moment. The claim was a mythical expression of qualities which history attests in the Athenian character, and of which the Athenians themselves were conscious as distinguishing them from other Greeks. It was Athenian to temper the letter of the law with considerations of equity (<foreign lang="greek">τοὐπιεικές</foreign>); to use clemency; to feel compassion (<foreign lang="greek">αἰδώς</foreign>) for unmerited misfortune; to shelter the oppressed; to restrict the sphere of violence; and to sacrifice,—where no other Greeks did,—at the altar of Persuasion<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Isoc. 15.249" valid="yes">Isocr. or. 15 § 249</bibl>.</note>. This character is signally impressed on the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>, and is personified in Theseus. The first session of the tribunal on the Hill of Ares was, in Attic story, the first occasion on which this humane character asserted itself against a hitherto inflexible precedent. Orestes slew his mother to avenge his father, whom she had slain; and the Erinyes demanded his blood. He is tried, and acquitted,—but not by the Erinyes; by Athene and her Athenian court. The Erinyes are the accusers, and Apollo is counsel for the prisoner. Then it is,— <emph>after</emph> the acquittal of Orestes,—that Athene's gentle pleading  effects a change in the defeated Avengers<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In the recent performance of the <title>Eumenides</title> by members of the University of Cambridge a beautiful feature was the expression of this gradual change. Dr Stanford's music for the successive choral songs from <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Eum. 778" valid="yes">v. 778</bibl> onwards interpreted each step of the transition from fierce rage to gentleness; and the acting of the Chorus was in unison with it throughout. We saw, and heard, the Erinyes becoming the Eumenides.</note>. They cease to be the Erinyes: they become the <soCalled>Benign</soCalled> or <soCalled>Majestic</soCalled> goddesses (<soCalled>Eumenides,</soCalled> <soCalled lang="en">Semnae</soCalled>), and are installed, as guardian deities of Attica, in a shrine beneath the Areiopagus. Henceforth they are symbols of the spirit which presided over the Attic criminal law of homicide (<foreign lang="greek">φόνος</foreign>),—so remarkable for its combination of the unbending religious view, in which bloodshed was always a pollution, with a finely graduated scale of moral guilt, and with ample provision for the exercise of clemency.
</p>
<p>Oedipus was a passive Orestes,—like him, the instrument of an inherited destiny, but, unlike him, a sufferer, not a doer; for his involuntary acts, as he could justly say, were in reality sufferings rather than deeds. The Eumenides of Colonus could not refuse to admit his plea, commended to them, as it was, by Apollo. His was a typical case for the display of their gentler attributes. And, as Greek religion was prone to associate the cult of deities with that of mortals in whom their power had been shown, it was natural that the Eumenides and Oedipus should be honoured at the same place. A chapel which Pausanias saw at Colonus was dedicated jointly to Oedipus and Adrastus, —a further illustration of this point. For Adrastus was another example of inevitable destiny tempered by divine equity; he shared in the Argive disasters at Thebes; but he was personally innocent; and, alone of the chiefs, he survived.

<p>The grave of Oedipus in Attic ground is to form a perpetual safeguard for Attica against invaders. It is interesting to observe ancient traces of an exactly opposite feeling with regard to his resting-place. According to a Boeotian legend<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 91" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 91</bibl>, quoting Lysimachus of Alexandria, in the 13th book of his <title lang="greek">*qhbai+ka/</title>. This Lysimachus, best known as the author of a prose <title lang="greek">*no/stoi</title>, lived probably <date authname="-25" value="-25">about 25 B.C.</date> See <bibl default="NO">Müller, <title>Fragm. Hist.</title> III. 334</bibl>.</note>, Oedipus died at Thebes, and his friends wished to bury him  there; but the Thebans refused permission. His friends then carried the body to <q direct="unspecified" lang="en">"a place in Boeotia called Ceos,"</q> and there interred it. But <q direct="unspecified" lang="en">"certain misfortunes"</q> presently befell the people of Ceos, and they requested the friends of Oedipus to remove him. The friends next carried him to Eteonus, a place near the frontier between Boeotia and Attica, and buried him by night, without knowing that the ground which they chose for that purpose was sacred to Demeter. The matter having become known, the people of Eteonus sent to Delphi, and asked what they were to do. Apollo replied that they must not <q direct="unspecified" lang="en">"disturb the suppliant of the goddess"</q> (Demeter). Oedipus was therefore allowed to rest in peace, and the place of his burial was thenceforth called the <title>Oedipodeum.</title> We see how this Boeotian dread of his grave, as a bane to the place afflicted with it, answers to the older conception of the Erinyes; just as the Attic view, that his grave is a blessing, is in unison with the character of the Eumenides. It is only when the buried Oedipus has become associated with a <emph>benevolent</emph> Chthonian power,—namely, with Demeter,—that he ceases to be terrible.

So, too, the grave of the Argive Eurystheus in Attica was to be a blessing for the land (<bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Her. 1032" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1032</bibl>). Nor did this belief relate merely to the great heroes of mythology; a similar power was sometimes ascribed to the graves of historical men. Thus, as we learn from Aristeides, the tomb of Solon in Salamis was popularly regarded as securing the possession of that island to Athens.

The epithet Hippius belonged to the god Poseidon, as horse-creating and horse-taming (see <ref targOrder="U" target="cl715">on 715</ref>); it was given to this place because Poseidon Hippius was worshipped there, and served to distinguish this extramural Colonus from the Colonus Agoraeus, or "Market Hill," within the walls of Athens<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In the district of Melitè (see map): cp. below, p. 5.</note>. In the absence of a distinguishing epithet, "Colonus" would usually mean Colonus Hippius; Thucydides calls it simply Colonus, and describes it as "a sanctuary (<foreign lang="greek">ἱερόν</foreign>) of Poseidon." His mention of it occurs in connection with the oligarchical conspiracy of <date authname="-411" value="-411">411 B.C.</date>, when Peisander and his associates chose Colonus, instead of the Pnyx, as the place of meeting for the Assembly which established the government of the Four Hundred. It is a fair, though not a necessary, inference from the historian's words that the assembly was held <emph>within</emph> the sacred precinct of Poseidon, with the double advantage  for the oligarchs of limiting the numbers and of precluding forcible interruption<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><cit><bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 8.67" valid="yes">Thuc. 8. 67</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ξυνέκλῃσαν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἐς τὸν Κολωνόν （ἔστι δὲ ἱερὸν Ποσειδῶνος ἔξω τῆς πόλεως, ἀπέχον σταδίους μάλιστα δέκα）</quote></cit>.—<bibl default="NO">Grote (VIII. 47)</bibl> renders <foreign lang="greek">ἱερόν</foreign> "temple," but it seems rather to denote the whole precinct sacred to Poseidon.  <bibl default="NO">Prof. Curtius (III. 438, Eng. tr.)</bibl> supposes the ecclesia to be held on the knoll of Colonus, near (and not within) the sanctuary,—understanding <foreign lang="greek">ξυνέκλῃσαν</foreign> to denote an enclosure made for the occasion, partly to limit the numbers, partly "on account of the proximity of the enemy's army" (at Deceleia). Grote refers <foreign lang="greek">ξυνέκλῃσαν</foreign> to some stratagem used by the oligarchs. I should rather refer it simply to the limit imposed by the <foreign lang="greek">ἱερόν</foreign> itself. Thucydides, as his words show, here identifies Colonus with the <foreign lang="greek">ἱερόν</foreign>. The temenos of Poseidon having been chosen as the place for the ecclesia, the <foreign lang="greek">περίστια</foreign> would be carried round its boundary; after which no person outside of that lustral line would be considered as participating in the assembly. A choice of place which necessarily restricted the numbers might properly be described by <foreign lang="greek">ξυνέκλῃσαν</foreign>.—Cp. <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1491">n. on 1491</ref>.</note>. The altar of Poseidon in this precinct is not visible to the spectators of our play, but is supposed to be near. When Pausanias visited Colonus (<date authname="180" value="180">c. 180 A.D.</date>), he saw an altar of Poseidon Hippius and Athene Hippia. A grove and a temple of Poseidon had formerly existed there, but had perished long before the date of his visit. He found, too, that divine honours were paid at Colonus to Peirithous and Theseus, to Oedipus and Adrastus: there were perhaps two shrines or chapels (<foreign lang="greek">ἡρῷα</foreign>), one for each pair of heroes<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">His use of the singular is ambiguous, owing to its place in the sentence: <cit><quote lang="greek">ἡρῷον δὲ Πειρίθου καὶ Θησέως Οἰδίποδός τε καὶ Ἀδράστου</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 1.30.4" valid="yes">(I. 30. 4)</bibl></cit>.</note>. He does not mention the grove of the Eumenides, which, like that of Poseidon, had doubtless been destroyed at an earlier period.
</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile N.E.N. of the Colonus Hippius <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Demeter Euchloüs.</note> rises a second mound, identified by E.

When Oedipus stood at the spot where he finally disappeared, this hill was "in full view" (<foreign lang="greek">προσόψιος</foreign>). Traces of an ancient building exist at its southern edge. Similar traces exist at the N.W. edge of the Colonus Hippius. If, as is likely, these ancient buildings were connected with religious purposes, it is possible that the specially sacred region of the ancient Colonus lay between the two mounds<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><p>The present aspect of Colonus is thus described by an accomplished scholar, <bibl default="NO">Mr George Wotherspoon (Longmans' Magazine, Feb. 1884)</bibl>:

<p>The "stone-capt mound" is the Colonus Hippius, on which are the monuments of Otfried Müller and Lenormant. If Colonus itself has thus lost its ancient charms, at least the views from it in every direction are very fine; especially so is the view of the Acropolis.</p>

But the only condition  fixed by the play fails to be precise, viz. that a road, passing by Colonus to Athens, skirted the grove,—the inner or most sacred part of the grove being on the side furthest from the road. The <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">A suggestion.</note>roads marked on our map are the ancient roads<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">On these, see the letter-press by Prof. Curtius to the <bibl default="NO"><title lang="de">Atlas von Athen,</title> pp. 14 f</bibl>.</note>.

There is no reason why the wandering Oedipus should not be conceived as entering Attica from the N.W.; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, as having passed into the Attic plain round the N. end of Aegaleos. And, in that case, the road in question might well represent the route by which Sophocles, familiar with the local details of Colonus in his own day, imagined Oedipus as arriving.

The part of the grove furthest from him (<cit><quote lang="greek">τοὐκεῖθεν ἄλσους</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>In this play the sanctities of Colonus are closely associated with those of the neighbouring Academy. To the latter belonged the altar of Prometheus (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

If the scholiast is right as to the situation of the temple, Eupolis used <foreign lang="greek">πόλεως</foreign> in the sense of "acropolis," as Athenians still used it in the time of <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 2.15" valid="yes">Thucydides (2. 15)</bibl>.</note>. Are we to suppose, then, that Sophocles alludes to the chasm at the Areiopagus, and that "the hill of Demeter Euchloüs" means this shrine of Demeter Chloë on the slope of the Acropolis? This view<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">It is beautifully and persuasively stated in <bibl default="NO">Wordsworth's <title>Athens and Attica</title>, ch. XXX. (p. 203, 4th ed.)</bibl>. The author holds that the poet, embarrassed by the rival claims of the Areiopagus and Colonus, intended to suggest the former without definitely excluding the latter.</note>—which the coincidence might reasonably suggest—seems to present insuperable difficulties. At <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 643" valid="yes">v. 643</bibl> Theseus asks Oedipus whether he will come to Athens or stay at Colonus. He replies that he will stay at Colonus, because it is the scene appointed for his victory over his foes (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 646" valid="yes">646</bibl>). But the victory was to take place at his grave (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 411" valid="yes">411</bibl>); which the poet therefore supposed to be at or near Colonus,—not at Athens. If, then, in the time of Sophocles an Areiopagus-legend already claimed the grave of Oedipus,  the poet disregarded it. And, when the grave was to be associated with Colonus, it would be strange to send Oedipus so far for the purpose of vanishing at the Areiopagus. The brevity of the choral ode which separates the final exit of Oedipus (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1555" valid="yes">1555</bibl>) from the entrance of the Messenger (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1579" valid="yes">1579</bibl>) implies, as does the whole context, that Oedipus passed away somewhere near the grove—not at a distance of more than a mile and a half, as the other theory requires. Then the phrase <cit><quote lang="greek">Εὐχλόου Δήμητρος πάγος</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1600" valid="yes">(1600)</bibl></cit> applies to the knoll far more naturally than to a shrine at the foot of the Acropolis. Referring to a tomb of Oedipus which he saw in the precinct of the Furies at the Areiopagus, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 1.28.7" valid="yes">Pausanias says: </bibl><quote lang="en">"On inquiry, I found that the bones had been brought from Thebes.

It did not occur to him that the Colonus-myth as to the grave could be harmonised with the Areiopagus-myth. Sophocles adopts the Colonus-myth unreservedly; nor can I believe that he intended, by any deliberate vagueness, to leave his hearers free to think of the Areiopagus. The chasm called the <foreign lang="greek">καταρράκτης ὀδός</foreign> must be imagined, then, as not very distant from the grove. No such chasm is visible at the present day in the neighbourhood of Colonus. But this fact is insufficient to prove that no appearance of the kind can have existed there in antiquity<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Prof. T. McK. Hughes, Woodwardian Professor of Geology in the University of Cambridge, kindly permits me to quote his answer to a question of mine on this point. His remarks refer to the general conditions of such phenomena in Greece at large, and must be taken as subject to the possibility that special conditions in the neighbourhood of Colonus may be adverse to the processes described; though I am not aware of any reason for thinking that such is the case. <quote lang="en">"It is quite possible that a chasm, such as is common in the limestone rocks of Greece, might become first choked, so as no longer to allow the passage of the winter's flood, and then overgrown and levelled, so that there might be no trace of it visible on the surface. The water from the high ground during winter rains rushes down the slopes until it reaches the jointed limestone rock. It filters slowly at first into the fissures. But the water, especially when it contains (as most surface water does) a little acid, dissolves the sides of the fissure, and soon admits sand and pebbles, the mechanical action of which hurries on the work of opening out a great chasm, which swallows up the winter's torrent, and becomes a katavothron.  But during the summer no water runs in, and, even without an earthquake shock, such a chasm may get choked. The waters which cannot find their way through then stand in holes, and deposit their mud. There would be for some time a pond above, but that would at last get filled, and all trace of the chasm be lost."</quote></note>.

This supposition is, however, extremely improbable, and derives no support from any stage arrangements  which the opening scene implies.  Rather the "Brazen Threshold" of <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 57" valid="yes">v. 57</bibl> was a name derived from the particular spot which is called the "sheer threshold," and applied in a larger sense to the immediately adjacent region, including the ground on which the grove stood. The epithet "brazen" properly belonged to the actual chasm or "threshold," — the notion being that a flight of brazen steps connected the upper world with the Homeric "brazen threshold" of Hades. In its larger application to the neighbouring ground, "brazen" was a poetical equivalent for "rocky," and this ground was called the "stay" or "support" (<foreign lang="greek">ἔρεισμα</foreign>) of Athens, partly in the physical sense of "firm basis," partly also with the notion that the land had a safeguard in the benevolence of those powers to whose nether realm the "threshold" led.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Evidence from Istros.</note>This view is more than a conjecture; it can be supported by ancient authority. Istros, a native of Cyrene, was first the slave, then the disciple and friend, of the Alexandrian poet Callimachus; he lived, then, <date authname="-240" value="-240">about 240 B.C.</date>, or less than 170 years after <date authname="-406" value="-406">the death of Sophocles</date><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Müller, <title>Fragm.

He is reckoned among the authors of <title>Atthides</title>, having written, among other things, a work entitled <title lang="greek">*)attika/</title>, in at least sixteen books. In the later Alexandrian age he was one of the chief authorities on Attic topography; and he is quoted six times in the ancient scholia on the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> One of these quotations has not (so far as I know) been noticed in its bearing on the point now under discussion; it does not occur in the scholium on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 57" valid="yes">v. 57</bibl>, but on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1059" valid="yes">1059</bibl>, in connection with another subject ("the snowy rock"). It would appear that in the first book of his <title lang="greek">*)attika/</title> Istros sketched an itinerary of Attica, marking off certain stages or distances. Along with some other words, the scholiast quotes these:—<quote lang="greek">ἀπὸ δὲ τούτου ἕως Κολωνοῦ παρὰ τὸν Χαλκοῦν προσαγορευόμενον· ὅθεν πρὸς τὸν Κηφισὸν ἕως τῆς μυστικῆς εἰσόδου εἰς Ἐλευσῖνα</quote>.  We do not know to what <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ τούτου</foreign> referred: but the context is clear. Two distances are here indicated: (1) one is from the point meant by <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>, "<emph>along the Brazen Threshold, as it is called</emph>," to Colonus: (2) the second is from Colonus "in the direction of the Cephisus, as far as the road by which the Initiated approach Eleusis," — <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, as far  as the point at which the Sacred Way crosses the Cephisus (see map). A third stage is then introduced by the words, <foreign lang="greek">ἀπὸ ταύτης δὲ</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">τῆς εἰσόδου</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">βαδιζόντων εἰς Ἐλευσῖνα</foreign>, etc. Thus the course of the second stage is from N.E. to S.W.; and the third stage continues the progress westward. Hence it would be natural to infer that the unknown point meant by <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτο</foreign>, from which one set out "along the Brazen Threshold," was somewhere to the E. or N.E. of Colonus. At any rate, wherever that point was, the question with which we are chiefly concerned is settled by this passage. The "Brazen Threshold" was not merely the name of a definite spot. It was the name given to a whole strip of ground, or region, "along which" the wayfarer proceeded to Colonus. And this perfectly agrees with the manner in which Sophocles refers to it (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 57" valid="yes">v. 57</bibl>).

<span class="line-ref">Line 16</span><p>In order to understand the opening part of the play (as <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Stage arrangements in the opening scene.</note> far as <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 201" valid="yes">v. 201</bibl>), it is necessary to form some distinct notion of the stage arrangements.  It is of comparatively little moment that we cannot pretend to say exactly how far the aids of scenery and carpentry were actually employed when the play was first produced at Athens.  Without knowing this, we can still make out all that is needful for a clear comprehension of the text.  First, it is evident that the back-scene (the palace-front of so many plays) must here have been supposed to represent a landscape of some sort,—whether the acropolis of Athens was shown in the distance, or not. Secondly, the sacred grove on the stage must have been so contrived that Oedipus could retire into its covert, and then show himself <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 138" valid="yes">(138)</bibl> as if in an opening or glade, along which Antigone gradually leads him until he is beyond the precinct.  If one of the doors in the back-scene had been used for the exit of Oedipus into the grove, then it would at least have been necessary to show, within the door, a tolerably deep vista.  It seems more likely that the doors of the back-scene were not used at all in this play.  I give a diagram to show how the action as far as <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 201" valid="yes">v. 201</bibl> might be managed<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">I was glad to find that the view expressed by this diagram approved itself to a critic who is peculiarly well qualified to judge, — Mr J. W. Clark, formerly Fellow of Trin. Coll., Cambridge.</note>.

</p>
<p>Antigone leads in her blind father on the spectators' left. She places him on a seat of natural rock (the "1st seat" in the diagram). This rock is just within the bounds of the grove; which evidently was not surrounded by a fence of any kind, ingress and egress being free. When the Chorus approach, Antigone and her father hide in the grove, following the left of the two dotted lines <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 113" valid="yes">(113)</bibl>.  When Oedipus discloses himself to the Chorus <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 138" valid="yes">(138)</bibl>, he is well within the grove. Assured of safety, he is gradually led forward by Antigone <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 173" valid="yes">(173-191)</bibl>, along the right-hand dotted line. At the limit of the grove, in this part, there is a low ledge of natural rock, forming a sort of threshold. When he has set foot on this ledge of rock,—being now just outside the grove,—he is told to halt <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 192" valid="yes">(192)</bibl>. A low seat of natural rock,—the outer edge (<foreign lang="greek">ἄκρου</foreign>) of the rocky threshold,— is now close to him. He has only to take a step sideways (<foreign lang="greek">λέχριος</foreign>) to reach it. Guided by Antigone, he moves to it, and she places him on it (the "2nd seat" in the diagram:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 201" valid="yes">v. 201</bibl>).

<span class="line-ref">Line 17</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Attic plays of Euripides.</note></p>
<p>Not only the local colour but the Athenian sentiment of the <title>Coloneus</title> naturally suggests a comparison, or a contrast, with some plays of Euripides. It may be said that the especially Attic plays of the latter fall under two classes. First, there are the pieces in which he indirectly links his fable with the origin of Attic institutions, religious or civil, though the action does not pass in Attica; thus the <title>Ion</title>,—of which the scene is at Delphi,— bears on the origin of the Attic tribes; the <title>Iphigenia in Tauris</title> refers to the cult of Artemis as practised in Attica at Halae and  Brauron. Then there are the more directly Athenian plays,— the <title>Supplices</title>, where Theseus takes the part of the Argive king Adrastus, and compels the Thebans to allow the burial of the Argives slain at Thebes; the <title>Heracleidae</title>, where the son of Theseus protects the children of Heracles,—as Theseus himself, in the <title>Hercules Furens</title> (of which the scene is at Thebes), had induced their father to seek an asylum at Athens. If the Attic elements in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> are compared with those of the plays just mentioned, the difference is easily felt. In the first of the two Euripidean groups, the tone of the Attic traits is antiquarian; in the second, it tends to be political,—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, we meet with allusions, more or less palpable, to the relations of Athens with Argos or with Thebes at certain moments of the Peloponnesian war. The <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> has many references to local usages,—in particular, the minute description of the rites observed in the grove of the Eumenides; it is a reflex of contemporary Attic life, in so far as it is a faithful expression of qualities which actually distinguished the Athens of Sophocles in public action, at home and abroad. But the poet is an artist working in a purely ideal spirit; and the proof of his complete success is the unobtrusive harmony of the local touches with all the rest. In <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Eumenides.</title></note> this respect the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> might properly be compared with the <title>Eumenides</title>,—with which it has the further affinity of subject already noticed above. Yet there is a difference. Contemporary events affecting the Areiopagus were vividly present to the mind of Aeschylus. He had a political sympathy, if not a political purpose, which might easily have marred the ideal beauty of a lesser poet's creation. Prudently bold, he deprived it of all power to do this by the direct simplicity with which he expressed it (<bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Eum. 693" valid="yes"><title>Eum.</title> 693-701</bibl>). The <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> contains perhaps one verse in which we might surmise that the poet was thinking of his own days <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1537" valid="yes">(1537)</bibl>; but it does not contain a word which could be interpreted as directly alluding to them.

The ancient belief is expressed by the well-known story for which Cicero is our earliest authority:—

<quote lang="en"><p>"Sophocles wrote tragedies to extreme old age; and as, owing to this pursuit, he was thought to neglect his property, he was brought by his sons before a court of law, in order that the judges might declare him incapable of managing his affairs,—as Roman law withdraws the control of an estate from the incompetent head of a family. Then, they say, the old man recited to the judges the play on which he was engaged, and which he had last written,—the <title>Oedipus Coloneus;</title> and asked whether that poem was suggestive of imbecility. Having recited it, he was acquitted by the verdict of the court."</p></quote>

I understand it to mean that he had lately finished the play, but had not yet brought it out; it was still "in his hands" for revision and last touches.

As to the recitation, a jury of some hundreds of citizens in an Athenian law-court formed a body to which such a <foreign lang="fr">coup de théâtre</foreign> could  be addressed with great effect.  The general spirit of Greek forensic oratory makes it quite intelligible that a celebrated dramatist should have vindicated his sanity in the manner supposed. The true ground for doubt is of another kind. It <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Its probable origin.</note> appears that an arraignment of the aged Sophocles, by his son Iophon, before a court of his clansmen (phratores), had furnished a scene to a contemporary comedy<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The passage which shows this is in the anonymous <foreign lang="greek">Βίος</foreign>; — <quote lang="greek">φέρεται δὲ καὶ παρὰ πολλοῖς ἡ πρὸς τὸν υἱὸν Ἰοφῶντα γενομένη αὐτῷ δίκη ποτέ. ἔχων γὰρ ἐκ μὲν Νικοστράτης Ἰοφῶντα, ἐκ δὲ Θεώριδος Σικυωνίας Ἀρίστωνα, τὸν ἐκ τούτου γενόμενον παῖδα Σοφοκλέα πλέον ἔστεργεν. καί ποτε ἐν δράματι εἰσήγαγε τὸν Ἰοφῶντα αὐτῷ φθονοῦντα καὶ πρὸς τοὺς φράτορας ἐγκαλοῦντα τῷ πατρὶ ὡς ὑπὸ γήρως παραφρονοῦντι· οἱ δὲ τῷ Ἰοφῶντι ἐπετίμησαν. Σάτυρος δέ φησιν αὐτὸν εἰπεῖν· εἰ μέν εἰμι Σοφοκλῆς, οὐ παραφρονῶ· εἰ δὲ παραφρονῶ, οὐκ εἰμὶ Σοφοκλῆς· καὶ τότε τὸν Οἰδίποδα ἀναγνῶναι</quote>. In the sentence, <foreign lang="greek">καί ποτε...εἰσήγαγε</foreign>, the name of a comic poet, who was the subject to <foreign lang="greek">εἰσήγαγε</foreign>, has evidently been lost. Some would supply <foreign lang="greek">Λεύκων</foreign>, one of whose plays was entitled <title lang="greek">*fra/tores</title>. Hermann conjectured, <foreign lang="greek">καί ποτε Ἀριστοφάνης ἐν Δράμασιν</foreign>,—Aristophanes having written a play called <title lang="greek">*dra/mata</title>, or rather two, unless the <title lang="greek">*dra/mata h)\ *ke/ntauros</title> and <title lang="greek">*dra/mata h)\ *ni/obos</title> were only different editions of the same.  Whoever the comic poet was, his purpose towards Sophocles was benevolent, as the phratores censured Iophon. This tone, at least, is quite consistent with the conjecture that the poet was Aristophanes (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Frogs 79" valid="yes"><title>Ran.</title> 79</bibl>).  Just after the death of Sophocles, Phrynichus wrote of him as one whose happiness had been unclouded to the very end—<foreign lang="greek">καλῶς δ’ ἐτελεύτης), οὐδὲν ὑπομείνας κακόν</foreign>. There is some force in Schneidewin's remark that this would be strange if the poet's last days had been troubled by such a scandal as the supposed trial.</note>; and it is highly probable that the comic poet's invention—founded possibly on gossip about differences between Sophocles and his sons —was the origin of the story. This inference is slightly confirmed by the words which, according to one account, Sophocles used in the law-court: <quote lang="greek">εἰ μέν εἰμι Σοφοκλῆς, οὐ παραφρονῶ· εἰ δὲ παραφρονῶ, οὐκ εἰμὶ Σοφοκλῆς</quote>. That has the ring of the Old Comedy<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">I need scarcely point out how easily the words could be made into a pair of comic trimeters, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>
<quote lang="greek"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="trimeter"><l>εἰ μὲν Σοφοκλέης εἰμί, παραφρονοῖμ’ ἂν οὔ·</l>
<l>εἰ δ’ αὖ παραφρονῶ, Σοφοκλέης οὐκ εἴμ’ ἐγώ</l></lg></quote>.
This would fit into a burlesque forensic speech, in the style of the new rhetoric, which the comedy may have put into the mouth of Sophocles. As though, in a modern comedy, the pedagogue should say,—<q direct="unspecified" lang="en">"If I am Doctor X., I am not fallible; if I am fallible, I am not Doctor X."</q></note>. The words are quoted in the anonymous Life of Sophocles as being recorded by Satyrus, a Peripatetic who lived <date authname="-200" value="-200">about 200 B.C.</date>, and left a collection of biographies.  His work appears to have been of a superficial character, and uncritical<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The literary vestiges of this Satyrus will be found in <bibl default="NO">Müller, <title>Fragm. Hist.</title> III. 159 ff</bibl>.</note>. The incident of the trial, as he found it in a comedy of the time of Sophocles, would doubtless have found easy acceptance at his hands. From Satyrus, directly or indirectly, the story was probably derived by Cicero and later writers.

<p>It must now be asked how far the internal evidence of the play supports the belief that it belongs to the poet's latest years. Lachmann, maintaining the singular view that the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> was <quote lang="en">"political through and through"</quote> (<quote lang="de">"durch und durch politisch"</quote>), held that it was composed just before the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, with the purpose of kindling Athenian patriotism. Another conjecture is that the play was prepared for the Great Dionysia of <date authname="-411" value="-411">411 B.C.</date>, just after the Government of Four Hundred had been established by the assembly held at Colonus; that Colonus Hippius may have been "in some special sense the Knights' Quarter"; that hence the play would commend itself to a class of men among whom the new oligarchy had found most of its adherents; and that, after the fall of the Four Hundred, political considerations prevented a reproduction of the play, until, after the poet's death, it was revived in <date authname="-402" value="-402">402 B.C.</date><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Prof. L. Campbell, <title>Sophocles</title>, vol. I. 276 ff</bibl>.</note> This is an ingenious view, but not (to my apprehension) a probable one.  That the play would have been especially popular with the Athenian Knights need not be doubted; but it is another thing to suppose that the composition of the play had regard to their political sympathies in <date authname="-411" value="-411">411 B.C.</date>  In a time of public excitement any drama bearing on the past of one's country is pretty sure to furnish some words that will seem fraught with a present meaning. We may grant that such a meaning would sometimes, perhaps, have been found by an Athenian spectator of this play, and also that the poet's mind, when he wrote it, was not insensible to the influence of contemporary events. But it seems not the less true to affirm that, from the first verse to the last, in great things and in small, the play is purely a work of ideal art.

<span class="line-ref">Line 20</span><p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Character of the composition.</note></p>
<p>Another species of internal evidence has been sought in the character of the dramatic composition. It has been held  that the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> shares certain traits with the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the other play which tradition assigns to the latest years of Sophocles. One such trait is the larger scope given to scenic effects which appeal to the eye and the ear,—such as the pitiable garb of Oedipus, the personal violence of Creon, the scenery of Colonus, the thunder-storm. Another is the change from a severer type of tragedy, which concentrates the interest on a single issue—as in the <title>Tyrannus</title>—to a type which admits the relief of secondary interests,—such as the cult at Colonus, the rescue of the maidens, the glory of Athens, the fortunes of Thebes. A third trait of similar significance has been recognised in the contemplative tendency of the play, which leaves the spectator at leisure to meditate on questions other than those which are solved by a stroke of dramatic action,—such as the religious and the moral aspects of the hero's acts, or the probable effect of his pleas on the Athenian mind<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See <bibl default="NO">Campbell, I. 259 ff.</bibl></note>. Akin to this tendency is the choice of subjects like those of the <title>Coloneus</title> and the <title>Philoctetes</title>, which end with a reconciliation, not with a disaster. And here there is an analogy with some of the latest of Shakspeare's plays,—the <title>Winter's Tale</title>, <title>Tempest</title>, and <title>Cymbeline</title>, —which end, as Prof. Dowden says, with <quote lang="en">"a resolution of the dissonance, a reconciliation."</quote><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO"><title>Shakspere—His Mind and Art</title>, p. 406.</bibl></note>
</p>
<p>It may at once be conceded that the traits above mentioned are present in the <title>Coloneus</title>, and that they are among those which distinguish it from the <title>Tyrannus.</title> The <title>Coloneus</title> is indeed more picturesque, more tolerant of a distributed interest, more meditative; and its end is peace. But it is less easy to decide how far these traits are due to the subject itself, and how far they can safely be regarded as distinctive of the poet's latest period. Let us suppose for a moment that external evidence had assigned the <title>Coloneus</title> to the earlier years of Sophocles. It would not then, perhaps, seem less reasonable to suggest that these same traits are characteristic of youth. Here, it might be said, we find the openness of a youthful imagination to impressions of the senses; its preference of variety to intensity, in the absence of that matured and virile sternness of dramatic purpose which can  concentrate the thoughts on a single issue; its affinity to such themes as temper the darker view of human destiny with some gladness and some hope. In saying this, I do not mean to suggest that the latter view of the traits in question is actually more correct than the former, but merely to illustrate the facility with which considerations of this nature can be turned to the support of opposite hypotheses.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Rhetoric.</note>Another feature of the play which has been supposed to indicate the <dateRange authname="-415/-400" from="-415" to="-400">close of the fifth century B.C.</dateRange> is the prominence of the rhetorical element in certain places, especially in the scenes with Creon and Polyneices. We should recollect, however, that the <title>Ajax</title> is generally allowed to be one of the earlier plays, and that the scenes there between Teucer and the Atreidae show the taste for rhetorical discussion quite as strongly as any part of the <title>Coloneus.</title> Rhetoric should be distinguished from rhetorical dialectic. Subtleties of the kind which appear in some plays of Euripides are really marks of date, as showing new tendencies of thought. But the natural rhetoric of debate, such as we find it in the <title>Ajax</title> and the <title>Coloneus</title>, was as congenial to Greeks in the days of Homer as in the days of Protagoras.

<p>Our conclusion may be as follows. There is no reason to question the external evidence which refers the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> to <dateRange authname="-410/-406" from="-410" to="-406">the latest years of Sophocles</dateRange>. But no corroboration of it can be derived from the internal evidence, except in one general aspect and one detail,—viz. the choice of an Attic subject, and the employment of a fourth actor. The Attic plays of Euripides, mentioned above, belong to the latter part of the Peloponnesian war, which naturally tended to a concentration of home sympathies. An Attic theme was the most interesting that a dramatist could choose; and he was doing a good work, if, by recalling the past glories of Athens, he could inspire new courage in her sons. If Attica was to furnish a subject, the author of the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> had no need to look beyond his native Colonus; and it is conceivable that this general influence of the time should have decided the choice. In three scenes of the play, four actors are on the stage together. This innovation may be allowed as indicating the latest period of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">A discussion of this point will be found below, in the note on the Dramatis Personae, p. 7.</note>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 71</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὡς πρὸς τί</lemma> goes with both participles, <foreign lang="greek">μολεῖν</foreign> with the second only. The Chorus are uncertain whether Oedipus has merely some <emph>message</emph> for Theseus, or wishes to bring him in person to the spot (as <foreign lang="greek">πομπός</foreign> might imply). Our pointing is better than <foreign lang="greek">ὡς πρὸς τί; λ. ἢ κ. μολεῖν</foreign>; The query turns more on the motive of the appeal than on a sharp contrast between its possible forms. <foreign lang="greek">λέξων</foreign> should not be joined with <foreign lang="greek">μολεῖν</foreign> (<quote lang="en">"<emph>bid</emph> him come,"</quote> Blaydes).
</p>
<p>The reading and explanation of the verse hinge on the question whether <foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> (1) belongs to <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τί</foreign>, = "with what view?" or (2) is final, = "in order that."  Now (1) is strongly supported by two other places of Soph., in each of which this formula stands, as here, at the beginning of a question: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1174" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1174</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ΟΙ. <emph>ὡς πρὸς τί</emph> χρείας;</quote></cit>  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1182" valid="yes"><title>Tr.</title> 1182</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ΥΑ. <emph>ὡς πρὸς τί</emph> πίστιν τήνδ’ ἄγαν ἐπιστρέφεις;</quote></cit>  The simple <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τί</foreign>; (also freq. in Soph.) = merely "with reference to what?" while <foreign lang="greek">ὡς πρὸς τί</foreign>= "with reference to what, in your conception or intention (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign>)?": hence the latter is appropriate when the questioner cannot imagine the agent's motive.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καταρτύσων μολεῖν</lemma>, to prepare things (to work upon his mind, directly or indirectly), so that he shall come: for the inf. cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1286" valid="yes">1286</bibl>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Rep. 562C" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Rep.</title> 562C</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τὴν πολιτείαν... παρασκευάζει τυραννίδος δεηθῆναι</quote></cit>: and for <foreign lang="greek">καταρτύω</foreign> of mental or moral influence, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plut. De Recta 38d" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Mor.</title> 38 D</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἂν...μὴ λόγοις χρηστοῖς ἀφαιρῶν ἢ παρατρέπων καταρτύῃ τὴν φύσιν</quote></cit>.
</p>
<p>With L's <foreign lang="greek">μόλοι</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ὡς</foreign> being then final), we must render: "That Theseus might come with what view (<foreign lang="greek">πρὸς τί</foreign>), —to say or to arrange (what)?"  The opt. can stand (in spite of <cit><quote lang="greek">κερδάνῃ</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 72" valid="yes">72</bibl></cit>), since <cit><quote lang="greek">ἆρ’ ἂν μόλοι;</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 70" valid="yes">(70)</bibl></cit> puts the case hypothetically: see on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl11">11</ref>. But: (<emph>a</emph>) the double <foreign lang="greek">μόλοι</foreign>, at the end of two successive verses, is intolerable.  Dindorf, therefore, conjecturally reads <foreign lang="greek">παρῇ</foreign>, which Wecklein and others adopt. (<emph>b</emph>) The antithesis between <foreign lang="greek">λέξων</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">καταρτύσων</foreign> is hardly clear.  Wecklein explains, <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς ποῖον λόγον ἢ ἔργον;</foreign>  Certainly <foreign lang="greek">τί λέξων ἢ δράσων</foreign> could mean, "for what conceivable purpose?" (cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 71" valid="yes"><title>O.T.</title> 71</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὅ τι δρῶν ἢ τί φωνῶν</quote></cit>): but <foreign lang="greek">καταρτύσων</foreign> would be a very strange substitute for <foreign lang="greek">δράσων</foreign>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 121</span><p> This verse is corrupt in the MSS., but two things seem clear: (1) there is no reason to suspect <foreign lang="greek">προσδέρκου</foreign>: (2) the singular <foreign lang="greek">λεῦσσε</foreign> must be restored, and placed <emph>after</emph> <foreign lang="greek">προσδέρκου</foreign>. The antistrophic verse <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 153" valid="yes">(153)</bibl> is <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐ μὰν ἔν γ’ ἐμοί</quote>. A long syllable is then wanted to complete the verse <foreign lang="greek">προσδέρκου, λεῦσσε</foreign>. Hermann's <foreign lang="greek">νιν</foreign> has been generally adopted. But <foreign lang="greek">λεῦσσε νιν</foreign> could only mean "<emph>see</emph> him":  not, "<emph>look for</emph> him": <foreign lang="greek">λεύσσειν τινά</foreign> could not stand for <foreign lang="greek">ζητεῖν τινα</foreign>. The MS. <foreign lang="greek">αὐτὸν</foreign> was prob. a gloss which came in after <foreign lang="greek">προσδέρκου</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">λεῦσσε</foreign> had been transposed; and the plur. <foreign lang="greek">λεύσσετε</foreign> may have arisen from <foreign lang="greek">λεῦσσε δή</foreign>.  In <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The schol. further remarks that Didymus (<date authname="-30" value="-30">circ. 30 B.C.</date>) had not obelized any part of the passage. This is important, as making it most improbable that the <quote lang="greek">ἀθέτησις</quote> rested on the absence of these verses from the older Alexandrian copies. Though the text is doubtful in some points, the internal evidence cannot be said to afford any good ground for suspicion.

<p>Wecklein brackets these nine verses, thinking that they arose from a misunderstanding of <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 551" valid="yes">551-554</bibl>. Theseus divined the <emph>name</emph> of Oedipus from the description of his <emph>person;</emph> but these vv. were inserted by one who thought it necessary to explain how Theseus knew the name. I hold the verses to be genuine. The <quote lang="greek">ξένος</quote> must have been sent to Athens by the Chorus before they came to the grove <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 117" valid="yes">(117)</bibl>, and could not, therefore, know the name of Oedipus (first disclosed at <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 222" valid="yes">222</bibl>). He could only tell Theseus that there was a blind stranger at Colonus, who hinted at his own power to confer benefits <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 72" valid="yes">(72)</bibl>, and who looked noble <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 76" valid="yes">(76)</bibl>. Theseus, on entering <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 551" valid="yes">(551)</bibl>, at once greets Oedipus by name, though he had never seen him before <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 68" valid="yes">(68)</bibl>. He had divined the identity through a knowledge of the history <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 553" valid="yes">(553)</bibl> — <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> he started from Athens on the strength of what the <quote lang="greek">ξένος</quote> could tell. And on the way to Colonus (adds Theseus) he has been made <emph>certain</emph> of the fact <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 554" valid="yes">(554)</bibl> — <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> he had heard the <emph>name.</emph> Now, it was precisely for such certainty that the dramatist meant this passage to provide. He felt that otherwise there might have been too great improbability in the instant confidence of the recognition by Theseus.

<p>There is no contrast in this play, as in the early part of the <title>Antigone</title>, between the spirit of the sisters. But the contrast between their circumstances indirectly exalts Antigone. She is wandering barefooted, enduring heat and cold (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 354</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαντεῖα πάντα</lemma> implies several oracles, given to the Thebans about Oedipus after he had left Thebes. There is no clue to their purport, and we need not ask: they are invented merely to create a pious office for Ismene. It would not have seemed well that she should have stayed at Thebes all these years without showing any active interest in his fate: on the other hand, the poetic legend required that Antigone should be the sole guide of his wanderings. The oracle about final rest had been given to Oed. in his youth (see on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl87">87</ref>); the oracle about his grave has only just been received at Thebes <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 389" valid="yes">(389)</bibl>. Between these two, the only oracle suggested by the Sophoclean version of the story is a response to the question which Creon had proposed to ask at Delphi (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1438" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1438</bibl>), as to whether Oed. should remain at Thebes. But the story of the expulsion (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 768" valid="yes">768 ff.</bibl>) implies that no such response had then been obtained.

<span class="line-ref">Line 367</span><p>Eteocles and Polyneices were young boys at the fall of Oedipus (see on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1">1</ref>), and their uncle Creon (brother of Iocasta) became regent (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1418" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1418</bibl>). As the two brothers grew up, they agreed, at first, in wishing to resign the throne, of which they were joint heirs, to Creon, lest Thebes should be tainted by their own rule; but afterwards they fell to striving with each other for the sole power.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔρως</lemma>, desire <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 436" valid="yes">(436)</bibl>, is a necessary and a certain correction. The MS. <foreign lang="greek">ἔρις</foreign> would have to mean "<emph>emulous</emph> desire," either (<emph>a</emph>) between the two brothers, if <quote lang="greek">τε … μηδέ</quote> = "<emph>both</emph>" … "and not": or (<emph>b</emph>) between the brothers and (<foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign>) Creon. Now, there is no objection to using <quote lang="greek">ἐρίζω, ἔρις</quote> of <emph>noble</emph> rivalry. The fatal objection is that the idea of <emph>rivalry</emph> at all is here completely,—almost ludicrously,—out of place. The notion that Soph. was thinking of the <quote lang="greek">ἀγαθὴ ἔρις</quote>, which rouses men to effort, as opp. to the <quote lang="greek">κακὴ ἔρις</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hes. WD 11" valid="yes">Hes. <title>Opp.</title> 11 ff.</bibl>), is surely very frigid. It is possible, however, that it was this notion which first brought <quote lang="greek">ἔρις</quote> into <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 367" valid="yes">367.</bibl>
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Κρέοντί τε</lemma>. The <foreign lang="greek">τε</foreign> = "both," answering to <foreign lang="greek">μηδέ</foreign> "and not."  So <quote lang="greek">τε</quote> is answered by <quote lang="greek">οὐδέ</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">οὔτε</quote>) <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. IT 697" valid="yes">Eur. <title>I. T.</title> 697</bibl>, or by <cit><quote lang="greek">δέ</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1312" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ph.</title> 1312</bibl></cit>.  So, too, <quote lang="greek">οὔτε</quote> by <quote lang="greek">δέ</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Supp. 223" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Suppl.</title> 223</bibl>, etc. Such irregularity is natural when the second thought is opposed to the first. The objection to reading <foreign lang="greek">μήτε</foreign> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 368" valid="yes">368</bibl> is that, while <quote lang="greek">οὔτε</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">μήτε</quote>)... <quote lang="greek">τε</quote> is common enough, there is no example of <quote lang="greek">τε...οὔτε</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">μήτε</quote>).</p>
<p>Paley's <quote lang="greek">Κρέοντι <emph>δὴ</emph></quote> is, however, highly probable. It would mean, "to Creon in the next resort."  So <foreign lang="greek">δὴ</foreign> is used of succession in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 173" valid="yes"><title>Ant.</title> 173</bibl>, where Creon says <quote lang="greek">ἐγὼ κράτη δὴ πάντα καὶ θρόνους ἔχω</quote>, I <emph>next</emph> (the sons of Oed. being dead); and <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

In some other such places, indeed, the inf. can be very easily corrected (as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Xen.

</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὡς … θεοὺς ἕξειν</lemma> may be sound.

<p>The tenor of this fine passage should be observed.</p>
<p>Oedipus took <cit><quote lang="greek">ἐν σοί</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 392" valid="yes">(392)</bibl></cit> to mean that the welfare of Thebes depended on his presence there.  He is thinking of a restoration to his Theban home <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 395" valid="yes">(395)</bibl>.  He asks, therefore, —"Of what use can I be to them if I am left at their doors, and not received within their land?" "They will suffer," she replies, "if your <emph>tomb</emph> is neglected."  Oedipus does not see the force of this answer: he still infers (from <foreign lang="greek">θανόντα</foreign> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 390" valid="yes">390</bibl>) that, whatever may be his doom in life, he is at least to be <emph>buried</emph> at Thebes. "Why, of course they will," he replies <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 403" valid="yes">(403)</bibl>. "<emph>So</emph>" — pursues the daughter <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 404" valid="yes">(404)</bibl> — "they mean to keep you within their grasp."  A new suspicion flashes on him. "They will <emph>bury</emph> me at Thebes?" "It cannot be." That is enough. He will never give himself into their hands. — Remark that he was supposing Apollo's former decree <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 91" valid="yes">(91)</bibl> to have been cancelled by this later one <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 389" valid="yes">(389)</bibl>. He now sees that the new oracle does <emph>not</emph> cancel the former, but merely confirms it in one aspect, viz. in the promise of <cit><quote lang="greek">ἄτην τοῖς πέμψασιν</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

(2) <foreign lang="greek">πρός</foreign> yields no tolerable sense. <quote lang="greek">ὑμεῖς, πρὸς ταῖς θεαῖς</quote>, "ye, <emph>in addition to</emph> the goddesses," ranks the Coloniates with, or above, their deities.

(Meisterhans, p. 88); but <quote lang="greek">ἤνεγκα</quote> is proved by metre in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 13" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 13</bibl> and <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 38" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 38</bibl>. <quote lang="greek">οὖν</quote> is suitable, when he is reluctantly proceeding to unfold his story in answer to their pressing demand.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἤνεγκ)</lemma> emphasises his ruling thought, his great plea— that he has been a <emph>sufferer</emph>, not a <emph>doer</emph> (267).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κακότατ)</lemma>, the misery of his two involuntary crimes. <quote lang="greek">ἤνεγκον ... ἤνεγκ)</quote> might possibly stand, but would be harsh.

<p>In the MS. reading, <quote lang="greek">ἤνεγκον—ἤνεγκον <emph>ἄκων</emph> μέν, <emph>ἄκων</emph></quote> is wrong, since metre requires <foreign lang="meter">u-</foreign> (cp. 510). With Bothe's <foreign lang="greek">ἑκὼν</foreign> the sense would be:—<quote lang="en">"I have endured misery through acts which were my own, indeed: but not one of them was done knowingly."</quote> The objections to this are insuperable. (1)</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεὸς ἴστω</lemma> must clearly have been preceded by the mention of some point to which he could appeal in an <emph>extenuation</emph> of his deed,—not by an admission, such as <quote lang="greek">ἑκών</quote> expresses. (2) <quote lang="greek">ἤνεγκον <emph>ἑκών</emph></quote>, in the supposed sense, is utterly at variance with the language and the whole tone of the play. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 239" valid="yes">239</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἔργων | ἀκόντων</quote></cit>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>It would be a subtlety foreign to Sophocles to make Oedipus say that he had acted <quote lang="greek">ἑκὼν</quote> when he did <emph>not</emph> act <quote lang="greek">φρονῶν</quote> (271), <quote lang="greek">εἰδώς</quote> (273), <quote lang="greek">ξυνιείς</quote> (976). <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

The Chorus have known all along that Oed. had married Iocasta, and also that he was the father of the girls (cp. 170, 322); but they are supposed to learn now for the first time that Iocasta was their mother. In the earlier versions of the Oedipus-myth (as in the <title>Odyssey</title>) Iocasta bears no issue to Oed.; his children are borne by a second wife, Euryganeia. The Attic poets seem first to have changed this (see Introd. to <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. xv). The Chorus would say: <quote lang="en">"Thine, then, they are by a double tie, at once as children and...as <emph>sisters?</emph>"</quote> but Oed. takes out of their mouths the second name which they shrink from uttering, and utters it himself with terrible emphasis.

Campbell suggests, <quote lang="en">"I murdered, and was convicted of the murder,"</quote> saying that <quote lang="greek">ἁλοὺς ἐφόνευσα</quote>=<quote lang="greek">ἑάλων φονεύσας</quote>. This is as if one said in English, <quote lang="en">"Having been hanged, he did the murder."</quote> To <foreign lang="greek">ἀγνώς</foreign> the short <quote lang="greek">α^</quote> would be a grave objection: Soph. has the first <quote lang="greek">α</quote> long thrice in <quote lang="greek">ἄγνοια</quote>, twice in <quote lang="greek">ἀγνοεῖν</quote>, once in <quote lang="greek">ἀγνώς</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>And all these corrections, confined to <foreign lang="greek">ἄλλους</foreign>, leave a blot. After <foreign lang="greek">ἐφόνευσα, καὶ ὤλεσα</foreign> is intolerably weak. Mekler's <foreign lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ ἄν, οὓς ἐφόνευς), ἔμ’ ἀπώλεσαν</foreign> brings out the point on which Oed. insists, and to which the words <quote lang="greek">νόμῳ καθαρός</quote> (548) refer,—viz. that, in slaying, he was defending his own life. Cp. 271. After he had returned the blow of Laïus, the attendants set on him (see on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 804" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 804</bibl>—812). The change of <quote lang="greek">ἐφόνευσ’ ἔμ’ ἀπώλεσαν</quote> into <quote lang="greek">ἐφόνευσα καὶ ἀπώλεσα</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">κἀπώλεσα</quote>) would have been easy if <quote lang="greek">ἐφόνευσά μ’ ἀπώλεσα</quote> had once been written.

<span class="line-ref">Line 589</span><p> Kayser's <foreign lang="greek">ἄναξ, χρῄζουσι</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκάζουσι</foreign>) is exactly what the sense requires, and is fairly near to the MS. reading, while the latter is (I think) certainly corrupt. The verse must not be considered alone, but in close connection with 590, and with the whole context. It has been rendered:—(1) <quote lang="en">"They are for compelling (<emph>my protectors</emph>) to convey me to Thebes."</quote> But the ellipse of <quote lang="greek">τινά</quote> before <quote lang="greek">κομίζειν</quote> is intolerable. And the protectors could not be required to do more than surrender him. Therefore it is no cure to propose <foreign lang="greek">εἴ ς)</foreign> (for <quote lang="greek">κεῖς)</quote>) <quote lang="greek">ἀναγκάσουσί με</quote>. To read <quote lang="greek">σε</quote> for <quote lang="greek">με</quote> merely shifts the first difficulty, and leaves the second. (2) <quote lang="en">"They are for putting constraint on me, so as to carry (me) to Thebes."</quote> Such an epexegesis by the <emph>act.</emph> infin. is impossible here. Who could write <quote lang="greek">ἀναγκάζει σε ἄγειν ἐκεῖσε</quote>, meaning, <quote lang="en">"he is forcing thee, so as to take (thee) thither"</quote>? (3) <quote lang="greek">κομίζειν</quote> has been taken as=<quote lang="en">"to return,"</quote>=<quote lang="greek">κομίζεσθαι</quote>. This needs no comment. We want either: (1) instead of <foreign lang="greek">κομίζειν</foreign>, a word=<quote lang="en">"<emph>to return</emph>"</quote>; but <quote lang="greek">κατελθεῖν</quote> is very unlikely, and no other substitute is obvious: or (2) instead of <foreign lang="greek">ἀναγκάζουσι</foreign>, a word = <quote lang="en">"they <emph>wish</emph>, <emph>seek.</emph>"</quote> That the fault lies in <quote lang="greek">ἀναγκάζουσι</quote> is very strongly suggested by 590, where L has <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ εἰ θέλοντ’ ἄν γ)</foreign>, evidently corrupted, by dittographia of <quote lang="greek">γ)</quote>, from <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ εἰ θέλοντά γ)</quote>, which L2 has. This gives a clear and fitting sense, if in 589 we read <foreign lang="greek">ἄναξ, χρῄζουσί με</foreign>. All the trouble, for the MSS. and for the edd., has arisen from <quote lang="greek">ἀναγκάζουσι</quote>. Hence (1) Goebel, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὐ θελόντων</foreign>, <quote lang="en">"but if they do not wish thee"</quote> (<quote lang="greek">φεύγειν</quote>): (2) Reisig, <foreign lang="greek">ἀλλ’ εἰ θέλοντάς γ)</foreign>, <quote lang="en">"but what if it be not seemly for thee to shun them when willing (to receive thee)?"</quote> Both these are forced. Campbell supplies <quote lang="greek">εἰ βούλοιντο κομίζειν</quote> to explain <quote lang="greek">θέλοντα</quote>, keeping L's <quote lang="greek">θέλοντ’ ἄν</quote>: but <quote lang="greek">ἄν</quote> can stand with a partic. only when the latter is equiv. to an apodosis, as it is in 761. So far as the tense of <quote lang="greek">ἀναγκάζουσι</quote> is concerned, a change to the <emph>fut.</emph> is no gain: it is the pres. of tendency or intention. But the whole mention of <emph>compulsion or violence</emph> is premature in 589. Oed. leads very gently up to the disclosure of his sons' unnatural conduct (599).

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δορύξενος</lemma>, <quote lang="en">"spear-friend,"</quote> is one with whom one has the tie of <quote lang="greek">ξενία</quote> in respect of war: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, who will make common cause with one in war. It is applied by Aesch., Soph., and Eur. only to princes or chiefs, with an armed force at their command. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

This is against the usage of the poets, our only witnesses. And the source of the guess is clear. Plutarch was thinking of the verbal compounds, <quote lang="greek">δοριάλωτος, δορίκτητος, δορίληπτος</quote>, etc. From these he inferred that <quote lang="greek">δορύξενος</quote> would mean primarily, <quote lang="en">"a friend gained through the spear."</quote></p>
<p>Wecklein brackets the whole passage from 632 <quote lang="greek">ὅτῳ</quote> down to 637 <quote lang="greek">τὴν τοῦδε</quote> as <quote lang="en">"a later addition,"</quote> because (1) there could be no <quote lang="greek">ξενία</quote> when Oedipus <emph>did not even know the name</emph> of Theseus (68), and (2) <quote lang="greek">σεβισθεὶς</quote> in 636 is suspicious. On this, see <foreign lang="la">ad loc.</foreign> As to (1), the <quote lang="greek">ξενία</quote> to which Theseus refers is not a personal friendship, but a hereditary alliance between the royal houses, as in <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

<span class="line-ref">Line 797</span><p>If <foreign lang="greek">οἶδα</foreign> is right (as it seems to be), <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> can hardly be explained otherwise than by emphasis, <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> by the <emph>strong assurance</emph> which the speaker expresses. But what form should the partic. have? (1) With the MS. <foreign lang="greek">πείθων</foreign>, the sense is: <quote lang="en">"However, I am assured that I am not persuading you of this,—go!"</quote> In <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 656" valid="yes">656</bibl> <quote lang="greek"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="trimeter"><l>οἶδ’ ἐγώ σε <emph>μήτινα</emph></l>
<l>ἐνθένδ’ ἀπάξοντ’ ἄνδρα</l></lg></quote></cit> appears to be a like case of <emph>strong assurance.</emph> Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1455" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1455</bibl>. In 1121 there is another: <quote lang="greek">ἐπίσταμαι γὰρ τήνδε... τέρψιν παρ’ ἄλλου <emph>μηδενὸς</emph> πεφασμένην</quote>. Here, however, <quote lang="greek">οἷδα <emph>μὴ</emph> πείθων</quote> is so far stranger, that the emphasis appears less appropriate in stating the speaker's consciousness <emph>of what he himself is doing.</emph> (2) The <foreign lang="la">v.l.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">πείθοντ)</foreign>, extant in at least one MS. (F), removes this objection. <quote lang="en">"However, I am assured <emph>that you are not persuading</emph> (either the Athenians or me, cp. 803)—go!"</quote> (3) <foreign lang="greek">πείσων</foreign> would be liable to the same remark as <quote lang="greek">πείθων</quote>. (4) <foreign lang="greek">πείσοντ)</foreign> would complete the parallelism with 656, but is not <emph>required</emph> by the <quote lang="en">"strong assurance"</quote> view, which applies to past (1121) or present as well as to future.—Another view is that <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> gives a <emph>quasi-imperative</emph> force: <quote lang="en">"I know that you <emph>shan't</emph> persuade."</quote> This might apply to 656. Here it is much more difficult, esp. if we do <emph>not</emph> adopt <quote lang="greek">πείσοντ)</quote>: in 1121 it fails.
</p>
<p>With <quote lang="greek">ἴσθι … με</quote> for <quote lang="greek">οἶδα...δε</quote> the imper. would explain <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> (cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl78">78</ref>): and we may note that in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 376" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 376</bibl> the MSS. changed <quote lang="greek">σε...ἑμοῦ</quote> into <quote lang="greek">με...σοῦ</quote>. But the context confirms <foreign lang="greek">οἶδα</foreign>.</p>
<p>In later Greek <quote lang="greek">μή</quote> with partic., in regard to <emph>fact</emph>, was common, as Luc. <title>Dial. Mort.</title> 16 <quote lang="greek">πῶς οὖν ἀκριβὴς ὁ Αἰακὸς ὢν οὐ διέγνω δε μὴ ὄντα ἐκεῖνον</quote>; <quote lang="en">"failed to discern that you were not he,"</quote> where <quote lang="greek">μὴ ὄντα</quote>, though it might be paraphrased by <quote lang="greek">εἰ μὴ ἦσθα</quote>, virtually=<quote lang="greek">ὅτι οὐκ ἦσθα</quote>. In Mod. Greek the partic. always takes <quote lang="greek">μή</quote>, not <quote lang="greek">δέν</quote>. This latter tendency may conceivably have affected our MSS.: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">τοιάδ’ οὐ πείθων</quote> may have once stood here.

Antistrophic to these are the 11 verses, 876—886, which in like manner follow the moment at which Creon lays his hand on Oedipus. As a lyric interposition in dialogue, the passage has a kommatic character, though it does not constitute a <quote lang="greek">κομμός</quote> proper in the same sense as 510—548, 1447—1499, or 1670— 1750.

Piderit is clearly right (I think) in giving this verse to the Chorus, not to Creon. Creon, who has long since dropped the semblance of courtesy with which he began (759), cannot, of course, mean to express serious deference for the wishes of Theseus; while, as an ironical defiance, the words would be extremely tame. In the mouth of the Chorus, however, the threat has point, since they know their king's public resolve (656); it has also dramatic force, since he is soon to appear (887). The words of Oed. (863) refer to 861.</p>

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δίστομοι … ὁδοί</lemma>. See map in Appendix on 1059. The two roads meant are probably:—(1) A road leading from Colonus, north of the Sacred Way, to the pass now called Daphnè, a depression in the range of Mount Aegaleos through which the Sacred Way issued from the plain of Athens, after which it skirted the shores of the bay of Eleusis. The beginning of this road is shown by the map in the Introduction. (2) A road diverging from the former in a N.W. direction, and going round the N. end of the same range of Aegaleos, at a point some miles N. of the Daphnè pass, into the Thriasian plain. By either route the captors could gain the pass of Dryoscephalae, over Mount Cithaeron, leading from Attica into Boeotia. The hope of Theseus is that the pursuers may reach the point of bifurcation before the captors, since it is conceivable that the latter should wait to be joined by their master, Creon. see on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1054">1054</ref> ff.

<p>L's <foreign lang="greek">λέγω</foreign>, of which <quote lang="greek">λέγων</quote> was a correction, came in by mistake from 936. Schneidewin's <foreign lang="greek">νέμων</foreign> has been generally received, and is clearly right: cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl879">879</ref>. While <foreign lang="greek">ἄνανδρον</foreign> answers to <quote lang="greek">κένανδρον ἢ δούλην</quote> in 917, <foreign lang="greek">ἄβουλον</foreign> (940), which implies the lack of a guiding mind, answers to <quote lang="greek">κἄμ’ ἴσον τῷ μηδενί</quote> in 918.—Creon's speech is as clever as it is impudent. He has only anticipated what the Athenians themselves would have wished. Indeed, he has acted in reliance on the Areiopagus (950). If his <emph>method</emph> has been rough, he was provoked by the violence of Oedipus.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τέκνων</lemma> has been suspected.

But here the sense should be, <quote lang="en">"unholy nuptials <emph>with parents</emph>"</quote>: cp. 978 <quote lang="greek">μητρὸς...γάμους</quote>. Can <foreign lang="greek">τέκνων</foreign>, then, be defended? Thus, I think.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ξυνόντες</lemma> suggests the <emph>consort.</emph> Hence <quote lang="greek">ἀνόσιοι γάμοι τέκνων</quote> is said, with poetical boldness and also with a certain designed obscurity, in this sense:—<quote lang="en">"<emph>a woman who has made an unholy marriage with her son.</emph>"</quote>
</p>
<p>Wecklein takes <quote lang="greek">τέκνων</quote> as "relative" gen. with <quote lang="greek">ἀνόσιοι</quote>, in the sense of <quote lang="greek">παιδουργίας, σπορᾶς</quote>:  "a marriage unholy in respect of its offspring."  This seems forced. Musgrave's <quote lang="greek">τοκέων</quote> would be more specious if the gen. of a noun in <quote lang="greek">‐εύς</quote> anywhere else suffered synizesis in this place of the verse.

Indeed that court is found exercising authority of a like kind (though only by special warrant) even after the reforms of Pericles and Ephialtes. Cp. Deinarchus or. 1 § 58, where the Ecclesia commissions the Areiopagus to inquire into the conduct of a merely suspected person, and the Areiopagus, having done so, reports to the Ecclesia (<quote lang="greek">τοῦ δήμου προστάξαντος ζητῆσαι τὴν βουλήν,...καὶ ζητήσασαν ἀποφῆναι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἀπέφηνεν ἡ βουλή</quote>, etc.).

W. Schmidt's <foreign lang="greek">ἐξειργασμένοι</foreign>.

</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξηρπασμένοι</lemma> must be explained in one of two ways. 1. <quote lang="en">"<title>The captured ones are speeding.</title>"</quote> Here (<emph>a</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">σπεύδουσιν</foreign> is most strange as=<quote lang="en">"are being carried off"</quote>: it should imply eagerness. (<emph>b</emph>) The masc. plur. is strangely used when <emph>two girls</emph> are definitely meant. It is different when a woman, speaking of <emph>herself</emph> in the <emph>plur.</emph>, uses the masc. (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 399" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 399</bibl>),— when the masc. sing. is used by the leader of a female Chorus (<bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Hipp. 1105" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Hipp.</title> 1105</bibl>),—or when the masc. sing. is used in an abstract statement, though with allusion to a woman (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 145" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 145</bibl>). 2. <quote lang="en">"<title>The captors are hurrying away.</title>"</quote> There is no  other instance of <quote lang="greek">ἥρπασμαι</quote>, simple or in comp., as a perf. middle, while the pass. use is common. This may be an accident, for there are several instances of perfect forms which can be either passive or middle,—<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">εἴργασμαι, τετιμώρημαι</quote> (pass. in <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 7.77" valid="yes">Thuc. 7.77</bibl>, midd. in <bibl default="NO" n="Antiph. 4.2.8" valid="yes">Antiph. <title>Tetr.</title> 3. <foreign lang="greek">β.</foreign> § 8</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">μεμίμημαι</quote> (pass. in <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 2.78" valid="yes">Her. 2.78</bibl>, midd. <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 2.169" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 169</bibl> etc.).

<span class="line-ref">Line 1055</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Θησέα</lemma> has the final <quote lang="greek">α</quote> long in 1458, but short here: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

Porson, who adds Philemon <foreign lang="la">ap.</foreign> Athen. 7. 307 E <quote lang="greek">κεστρἔ ὀπτόν</quote>. Is the MS. <foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign> after <quote lang="greek">Θησέα</quote> genuine? If so, <foreign lang="greek">ἐμμείξειν</foreign> is here intrans., like <quote lang="greek">ἐπι‐, προς‐, συμμιγνύναι</quote>: and the sense is, <quote lang="en">"Theseus and the two maidens will soon <emph>meet</emph> amid a battle-cry of confident prowess."</quote> Thus with <foreign lang="greek">ἐμμείξειν</foreign> we are to understand <quote lang="greek">ἀλλήλοις</quote>. The verb is fitting, because the maidens, though their sympathies are with Theseus, are <emph>in the midst of the hostile force.</emph></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτάρκει βοᾷ</lemma> is dat. of circumstance. This I believe to be the right view. <title>Not</title>, <quote lang="en">"Th. and the maidens will join battle <emph>with the foe</emph>,"</quote> <foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">τοῖς πολεμίοις</quote>: for the maidens are in the hands of the foe. Such a phrase is not defensible merely because <emph>in spirit</emph> they are with Theseus.</p>
<p>Many critics, however, now regard <foreign lang="greek">καὶ</foreign> as spurious: for <foreign lang="greek">Θησέα καὶ</foreign> Dindorf proposes <foreign lang="greek">Αἰγεΐδαν</foreign>: for <foreign lang="greek">Θησέα καὶ τὰς</foreign> Wecklein <foreign lang="greek">Θησέα παῖδας</foreign>. The sense would then be:—<quote lang="en">"Theseus will soon <emph>bring</emph> the sisters <emph>into</emph> (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, will soon raise around them) a battle-cry of confident prowess,"</quote>—by attacking their captors. This is possibly right: but a change of <foreign lang="greek">καὶ τὰς</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">παῖδας</foreign> is hardly likely. In <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 79" valid="yes"><title>Ph.</title> 79</bibl> <quote lang="greek">παῖ</quote>, which  Erfurdt changed to <quote lang="greek">καί</quote>, is clearly sound.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διστόλους</lemma>=<quote lang="en">"two journeying"</quote> sisters, —as borne off by their captors: see on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl17">17</ref> <quote lang="greek">πυκνόπτεροι</quote>. Not, <quote lang="en">"separately carried off,"</quote> with ref. to two bands of Thebans (cp. 818).
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτάρκει</lemma>, <quote lang="en">"self-sufficing,"</quote> and so <quote lang="en">"self-reliant,"</quote> giving confident promise of victorious rescue.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τούσδ’ ἀνὰ χ.</lemma>: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> in Attica, before the border can be passed.</p>
<p>The poet has left the details of the rescue indistinct. Creon's guards first carried off the girls (844), and Theseus sent mounted Athenians in pursuit (897). Afterwards, Theseus commands Creon to lead him to where the girls are; if they are <quote lang="en">"in these regions"</quote> (1020 <quote lang="greek">ἐν τόποισι τοῖσδ)</quote>), Theseus himself will recover them: if, however, the guards are already flying with them, then <title>Theseus</title> has nothing to do; the mounted Athenians, who have already started, will pursue (1020 ff.). But from the words of Theseus in 1148 it is plain that they have been rescued by his personal prowess, of which he forbears to boast (<quote lang="greek">κομπεῖν</quote>, 1149): and the same inference must be drawn from Antigone's words (1117). How are these facts to be reconciled? We can only suppose that the mounted Athenians, who started first, halted to watch the <quote lang="greek">δίστομοι ὁδοί</quote> (900), while Creon's guards also halted somewhere in concealment, to await their master. Theseus, with Creon, was thus enabled to overtake his Athenians before the struggle. The fact is that Sophocles did not care to think out these points, about which an Athenian audience in the theatre would not trouble themselves. Cp. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 758" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 758</bibl>.

The fut. seems defensible here, as=<quote lang="en">"they will (presently) approach"</quote>: though Hartung's <foreign lang="greek">περῶς)</foreign> may be right.

Οἰάτιδος νομόν</foreign>: <quote lang="en">"<emph>or perchance they will presently approach the pastures to the west of the snowy rock of Oea.</emph>"</quote>
</p>
<p>The place meant is not certain. See note and map in Appendix. But the scholium here deserves at least thus much weight: it is our one ancient warrant for a definite view. Like the other old scholia in L, it probably dates (in substance) from the later Alexandrian age, which possessed many Attic writings,  now lost, on the topography of Attica. The scholiast takes the <foreign lang="greek">νιφὰς πέτρα</foreign> to be a rock or crag of Mount Aegaleos;— the same which was called <quote lang="greek">λεία πέτρα</quote>, <quote lang="en">"the smooth rock,"</quote> by Istros, a writer on Attica, c. 240 B.C., whom he quotes. The schol. then explains <foreign lang="greek">Οἰάτιδος</foreign> by the fact that Aegaleos <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων ἐστὶ τοῦ δήμου τούτου</quote>, <quote lang="en">"skirts that deme,"</quote> —namely, of <quote lang="greek">Οἴη</quote>. It cannot reasonably be doubted that this statement about <quote lang="greek">Οἴη</quote>, if it did not rest on the scholiast's own knowledge, was derived from Istros, or from some other old writer on Attic topography.
</p>
<p>The meaning will then be:—<quote lang="en">"Or perhaps the captors did not take the road through the pass of Daphnè, which goes by the sea-coast to Eleusis. Perhaps they went round the N. end of Aegaleos, and will soon be emerging on the Thriasian plain, to the west of Aegaleos, near the deme of Oea."</quote> This is also Leake's view (<title>Demi of Attica</title> p. 154). The route supposed would be in the general line of that taken by Archidamus and the Peloponnesians in 431 B.C., when they moved from Oenoe E.S.E. to Acharnae, <quote lang="greek">ἐν δεξιᾷ ἔχοντες τὸ Αἰγάλεων ὄρος</quote>,— <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> keeping it to the S.,—<quote lang="greek">διὰ Κρωπιᾶς</quote>, a deme in the valley between the N. end of Aegaleos and the S.W. end of Parnes. Hartung, referring to the <quote lang="greek">λεία πέτρα</quote> of Istros, conjectures <foreign lang="greek">λι^τάδος</foreign>, as=<quote lang="en">"smooth,"</quote> for <foreign lang="greek">νιφάδος</foreign>: but though late poets could use <quote lang="greek">λι^τός</quote> for <quote lang="greek">λι—τός</quote>, the <quote lang="greek">ι^</quote> is most improbable for Soph.

<p>Rhea, in the Greek theogony, is daughter of Uranos and Gaia, wife of Cronus, and "mother of the gods." The cult was that of the "Phrygian Mother" Cybele in a special phase, and came very early to Greece from Lydia: in Attica it was intimately connected with the Eleusinian cult of Demeter (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="HH 5.442" valid="yes"><title>Hom.

The <quote lang="greek">Μητρῷον</quote> at Athens, the temple of Rhea Cybele, contained a celebrated statue of the goddess, by Pheidias or his pupil Agoracritus.

</p>
<p>To <foreign lang="greek">ἀνδώσειν</foreign> the objections are: (1) it could not possibly mean <quote lang="greek">ἀποσώσειν</quote>, <quote lang="en">"give <emph>back.</emph>"</quote> In Pind. fr. 133. 3, the sole passage quoted for this sense, <quote lang="greek">ἀνδιδοι ψυχὰν πάλιν</quote> is not <quote lang="en">"gives <emph>back</emph>,"</quote> but <quote lang="en">"sends <emph>up</emph>,"</quote> to the sunlight,—like <quote lang="greek">γῆ ἀναδίδωσι καρπόν</quote>. We must not be confused by our  <quote lang="en">"give <emph>up.</emph>"</quote> (2) To supply <quote lang="en">"Creon"</quote> or <quote lang="en">"the enemy"</quote> as subject is extremely awkward. (3) The <emph>sing.</emph> <foreign lang="greek">τὰν...τλᾶσαν</foreign>, etc., which this requires, cannot well be defended on the ground that Antigone is chiefly thought of.
</p>
<p>With <foreign lang="greek">ἐνδώσειν</foreign> we have to render:— <quote lang="en">"that <emph>the sufferings</emph> of those who have endured dread things, and found dread sufferings at the hands of kinsmen, will <emph>remit</emph>,"</quote>—become milder. Hippocrates (<title>Progn.</title> 43) uses the intrans. <quote lang="greek">ἐνδιδόναι</quote> of a malady which <emph>remits</emph> its force. But is <quote lang="greek">πάθη … ἐνδώσειν</quote> tolerable here, where the question is not of the sisters' sufferings being <emph>mitigated</emph>, but of their triumphant deliverance from the hands of the enemy? If, again, <quote lang="greek">ἐνδώσειν</quote>=<quote lang="en">"give up,"</quote> it incurs the 2nd and 3rd objections to <quote lang="greek">ἀνδώσειν</quote>.

<p>With <quote lang="greek">κἀναπαύσατον</quote> (note that L has <foreign lang="greek">κἀναπαύσετον</foreign>) the words are usu. taken to mean, "and give me relief from this hapless wandering, desolate before," —<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> since Antigone was carried off <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 844" valid="yes">(844)</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πλάνου</lemma>, then, must mean, "wanderer's doom," for we cannot explain it merely of restless movements on the scene since his daughter's departure. But this seems forced. Wecklein explains it <emph>figuratively</emph>, of the insecurity felt by a blind man who has no guide (<quote lang="de">"Haltlosigkeit und Unsicherheit, wie sie der Blinde ohne Führer  fühlt"</quote>). But how could <foreign lang="greek">πλάνου</foreign> <emph>alone</emph> denote this mental state? Neither <quote lang="greek"><emph>τὸν</emph> πρόσθ’ ἔρη<emph>μον</emph> tou=de dusth/nou pla/nou</quote> nor <quote lang="greek">τοῦ πρ. ἐρήμου <emph>τόν</emph>δε δύστη<emph>νον</emph> pla/nou</quote> mends matters. Schneidewin (rightly, I think) referred <foreign lang="greek">πλάνου</foreign> to the carrying away of the maidens by Creon's guards, rendering, "<emph>repose from</emph> your late forlorn and hapless wandering."  But <quote lang="greek">ἀναπαύσατον</quote> could not thus stand for the midd.: when the act. seems to do so, there is an acc. to be mentally supplied, as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 4.11" valid="yes">Thuc. 4.11</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἀναπαύοντες ἐν τῷ μέρει</quote></cit>, (not "resting," but) "relieving (their comrades) in turn": <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Xen. Hell. 5.1.21" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Hellen.</title> 5.1.21</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀπεῖχε πέντε ἢ ἓξ στάδια τοῦ λιμένος ἡσυχίαν εἶχε καὶ ἀνέπαυε</quote></cit> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">τὰς ναῦς</quote>). I would read <foreign lang="greek">κἀναπνεύσατον</foreign>: for the gen. cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

At such a moment it is surely natural that the father should have a word of sympathy for the late terror and distress of his helpless daughters, instead of dwelling solely on the pain to <emph>himself</emph> of being left without their support. The <foreign lang="greek">ε</foreign> in L is a trace of the truth.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1118</span><p> Hermann's change of the MS. <foreign lang="greek">τοὐμὸν</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">τοῦτ’ ἐμοί τ)</foreign> has been accepted by many edd.

The alternative version would be worse still: <quote lang="en">"this <emph>task</emph> (viz. that of reciting, or of hearing) will be short both for thee and me."</quote> I cannot but think, then, that this popular correction, though palaeographically easy, is untenable.

<p>I have little doubt that Wex is right, or nearly so, in his <foreign lang="greek">οὗ κἄστι τοὔργον</foreign>.

<p>Oedipus is indeed <quote lang="greek">ἱερός</quote> (287), as the suppliant of the Eumenides, and <quote lang="greek">εὐσεβής</quote> (<foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign>), as obeying the word of Apollo; but at this moment he feels that, in the eye of religious law, he is still formally what Creon has just called him—<quote lang="greek">πατροκτόνος</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἄναγνος</quote> (944). Contrast the more passionate strain of his words in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1413" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1413</bibl>, when he urges the Thebans to cast him forth—<quote lang="greek">ἴτ), ἀξιώσατ’ ἀνδρὸς ἀθλίου θιγεῖν</quote>. To touch him—he there says—can defile no one, because his unique doom places him apart.

This man said merely that he was a kinsman of Oedipus; and that he wished to speak a few words to him (1162). The fact that he was not from Thebes, but from Argos (1167), seems to have been inferred from something in his dress, for Theseus says that he does not <emph>know</emph> whence the man had come (cp. 1161). Polyneices took this precaution of becoming a <quote lang="greek">ἱκέτης</quote> because he did not know what power might now be at the command of the paternal anger which he foresaw (cp. 1165).

The oracle brought to Oed. by Ismene (389) had been received at Thebes (apparently) before the expulsion of Polyneices, since Oed. complains that the two brothers did not avail themselves of it in order to recall him (418). It was to the effect that the welfare of Thebes depended on Oedipus. If Polyneices means the same oracle here, <foreign lang="greek">οἷς ἂν</foreign> will be Thebes, on the one hand, and any foreign foe of Thebes on the other. But the reference here is rather to a special oracle concerning the war between the brothers, which Polyneices has heard from the <quote lang="greek">μάντεις</quote> at Argos (cp. 1300).

For the latter, Herm. urged that (1) Oed. is too angry to be so polite, and (2) the mere name of Theseus is not enough here, without a title. Both these arguments might with more justice be inverted: for (1) it is precisely in the formal <quote lang="greek">ἄνδρες τῆσδε δημοῦχοι χθονός</quote> that we catch the note of suppressed passion; (2) <quote lang="greek">Θησεύς</quote>, so emphatic as the first word in 1350, would be <emph>weakened</emph> by <quote lang="greek">δημοῦχος</quote> in 1348: and (3) with <quote lang="greek">δημοῦχος</quote> we should here need the article. The elders of Colonus are addressed as <quote lang="en">"guardians of this land"</quote> because, in the temporary absence of Theseus, they represent him. So 145 (to the Chorus) <quote lang="greek">ὦ τῆσδ’ ἔφοροι χώρας</quote>.

His former imprecation, uttered on hearing Ismene's tidings, implied the same doom which is more plainly denounced here (421—427: 451 f.). Manifestly it is to this that <foreign lang="greek">πρόσθε</foreign> refers. Campbell holds, however, that, in this passage, Sophocles has abandoned what is otherwise the distinctive point in his conception of the curse on the sons,— viz. that it was delivered only <emph>after</emph> the outbreak of their strife for the throne (cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1298">1298</ref>),—and that <foreign lang="greek">πρόσθε</foreign> denotes some moment before Oed. had left Thebes.

Curtius (<title>Verb</title> 1. 80, Eng. tr. 53) would leave the normal <quote lang="greek">‐τον</quote> where, as here, the MSS. support it. Though Attic usage, misled by the analogy of <quote lang="greek">‐την</quote> in the 3rd pers., sometimes admitted it in the 2nd, it also (he thinks) retained <quote lang="greek">‐τον</quote>. The tendency of recent editors has been to write <quote lang="greek">‐την</quote> everywhere. But, in the absence of better proof that <quote lang="greek">‐τον</quote> had been wholly discarded, a consensus of MSS. seems entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1414</span><p> — <emph>1446</emph> The dialogue between sister and brother illustrates her affection for him, and thus strengthens the link (1405 ff.) between this play and the <title>Antigone.</title> It has, however, a further dramatic purpose. The version of the paternal curse adopted by Sophocles tended to suggest this question to the spectator:—Why should Polyneices persevere in the war, when his defeat and death had been definitely foretold to him? For he plainly believes the prediction (cp. 1407, 1435), though he affects to think that there is a chance of escape (1444).  The answer is furnished by the traits of his character which this dialogue brings out.

<l>στράτευμ’ <emph>ἄγοιμι</emph> ταὐτόν</l></lg></quote> is defensible if we take <foreign lang="greek">πῶς ἄγοιμι</foreign> as dubitative, "How could I <emph>possibly</emph> lead?" See Appendix on 170. But there is at least a strong probability that the poet used <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> here, instead of employing the much rarer construction. So far as our MSS. are concerned, the dropping out of <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ἄγοιμι</foreign> is not much less likely than the change of <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">αὖ</foreign>. Either would have been easy. I prefer <quote lang="greek">αὖθις <emph>ἂν</emph>... <emph>ἄγοιμι</emph></quote> to <quote lang="greek">αὖθις αὖ...<emph>ἄγοιμ’ ἄν</emph></quote>, because <foreign lang="greek">ἄν</foreign> is thus more forcibly placed, and serves also to bring out <foreign lang="greek">αὖθις</foreign>. We have <quote lang="greek">αὖθις αὖ πάλιν</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The conjecture <foreign lang="greek">εὖ διδοίη</foreign> (Burges), accepted by some of the best edd., effaces a natural and pathetic touch. The MS. <foreign lang="greek">σφῷν</foreign>, if right, might be compared with the dat. after words of showing favour (<quote lang="greek">εὐμενής</quote> etc.): perhaps also with the dat. after <quote lang="greek">ἡγεῖσθαι</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ὁδοποιεῖν</quote>. But in 1407, where <foreign lang="greek">σφώ</foreign> is certain, the MSS. have <foreign lang="greek">σφῷν</foreign>: and the acc. with <quote lang="greek">εὐοδοῦν</quote> is slightly recommended by the analogy of <quote lang="greek">ὁδοῦν, ὁδηγεῖν</quote>. Suidas, too, has <quote lang="greek">εὐοδῶ· αἰτιατικῇ</quote>: though this might be explained by the post-classical constr. of <quote lang="greek">εὐοδοῦν</quote>, which, as in the Septuagint, was with acc.

With Lobeck, I hold the simple transposition to be the true remedy. The <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> of the dative could be elided in Homeric Greek; but among the alleged instances in Attic drama there is not one which bears examination. See Appendix.

But the harshness is at least much less than that of such zeugmas as Greek idiom permitted (cp. 1357), and does not seem to warrant the view that the verse is spurious. The conjecture <foreign lang="greek">οὔ με ζῶντά γ)</foreign> is improbable.—It has been said that the thought is repeated in <quote lang="greek">οὐ γάρ μ’ ἔτι | βλέποντ’ ἐσόψεσθ’ αὖθις</quote>: but the latter is a different statement, and a climax—<quote lang="en">"Ye will be able to <emph>serve</emph> me no more while I live—nay, ye will no more <emph>see</emph> me alive."</quote>

<span class="line-ref">Line 1447</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα τάδε … κιγχάνει</lemma>. Two views are admissible: I prefer that which is here placed first. (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"I have seen come,"</quote> not, <quote lang="en">"have come <emph>on</emph> me,"</quote> <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> being ethic dative (81). The Chorus alludes to the doom pronounced on Polyneices and his brother. <quote lang="en">"Here are new ills which I have seen come from the blind stranger,—unless perchance, Fate is finding fulfilment."</quote> Oedipus has often spoken of the fate which pursues his race (964 etc.), and the Chorus correct their first phrase by surmising that haply this fate, not Oedipus, is the real agent of the doom on the brothers. The schol. took <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign> as a foreboding of the Chorus that they might be <emph>involved</emph> in these alien ills: but <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> seems merely to express sympathy.
</p>
<p>(2) Others suppose that a low rumbling of thunder was heard immediately after the exit of Polyneices, and that <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτυπεν αἰθήρ</foreign> in 1456 merely marks the first <emph>loud</emph> sound. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα τάδε … κακὰ</lemma> are then the evils which the Chorus forebode from the <emph>incipient</emph> thunder: <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"have come <emph>upon</emph> me."</quote></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἴ τι μοῖρα μὴ κιγχάνει</lemma> is then taken either as before, or thus:—<quote lang="en">"if haply <emph>his end</emph> is not coming upon him."</quote>  To this view we may object:—（<emph>a</emph>) It is much more natural to suppose that the <emph>beginning</emph> of the thunder is denoted by <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτυπεν</foreign>. Each step in the <emph>crescendo</emph> of the thunder is marked by words of the Chorus: a second, and louder, peal comes at 1462, a third at 1476. The whole effect of the passage depends on the moralising of the Chorus (1451 ff.) being interrupted by the sudden crash at 1456. (<emph>b</emph>) After the exit of Polyneices, we naturally expect from the Chorus some comment on the father's curse and the son's doom. (<emph>c</emph>) If <foreign lang="greek">νέα κακὰ</foreign> meant <quote lang="en">"new ills"</quote> brought <emph>on the Chorus</emph> by Oed., the language would rather imply that they had suffered something else from him before,—which is not the case.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νεόθεν</lemma> strengthens <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα</lemma>, and might mean, <quote lang="en">"from a new occasion"</quote> (the visit of Polyneices); but it seems more probable that the poet used it merely in the sense of <quote lang="en">"newly"</quote> (lit., <quote lang="en">"from a recent moment"</quote>); schol. <quote lang="greek">νεωστί</quote>. For the form cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1447</span><span class="line-ref">Line 1447</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα τάδε … κιγχάνει</lemma>. Two views are admissible: I prefer that which is here placed first. (1) <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"I have seen come,"</quote> not, <quote lang="en">"have come <emph>on</emph> me,"</quote> <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> being ethic dative (81). The Chorus alludes to the doom pronounced on Polyneices and his brother. <quote lang="en">"Here are new ills which I have seen come from the blind stranger,—unless perchance, Fate is finding fulfilment."</quote> Oedipus has often spoken of the fate which pursues his race (964 etc.), and the Chorus correct their first phrase by surmising that haply this fate, not Oedipus, is the real agent of the doom on the brothers. The schol. took <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign> as a foreboding of the Chorus that they might be <emph>involved</emph> in these alien ills: but <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> seems merely to express sympathy.
</p>
<p>(2) Others suppose that a low rumbling of thunder was heard immediately after the exit of Polyneices, and that <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτυπεν αἰθήρ</foreign> in 1456 merely marks the first <emph>loud</emph> sound. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα τάδε … κακὰ</lemma> are then the evils which the Chorus forebode from the <emph>incipient</emph> thunder: <foreign lang="greek">ἦλθέ μοι</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"have come <emph>upon</emph> me."</quote></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἴ τι μοῖρα μὴ κιγχάνει</lemma> is then taken either as before, or thus:—<quote lang="en">"if haply <emph>his end</emph> is not coming upon him."</quote>  To this view we may object:—（<emph>a</emph>) It is much more natural to suppose that the <emph>beginning</emph> of the thunder is denoted by <foreign lang="greek">ἔκτυπεν</foreign>. Each step in the <emph>crescendo</emph> of the thunder is marked by words of the Chorus: a second, and louder, peal comes at 1462, a third at 1476. The whole effect of the passage depends on the moralising of the Chorus (1451 ff.) being interrupted by the sudden crash at 1456. (<emph>b</emph>) After the exit of Polyneices, we naturally expect from the Chorus some comment on the father's curse and the son's doom. (<emph>c</emph>) If <foreign lang="greek">νέα κακὰ</foreign> meant <quote lang="en">"new ills"</quote> brought <emph>on the Chorus</emph> by Oed., the language would rather imply that they had suffered something else from him before,—which is not the case.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νεόθεν</lemma> strengthens <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νέα</lemma>, and might mean, <quote lang="en">"from a new occasion"</quote> (the visit of Polyneices); but it seems more probable that the poet used it merely in the sense of <quote lang="en">"newly"</quote> (lit., <quote lang="en">"from a recent moment"</quote>); schol. <quote lang="greek">νεωστί</quote>.

Many recent critics have held that <foreign lang="greek">φρενί</foreign> has come in from 1487. So far as the mere <emph>repetition</emph> is an argument, we must be cautious in applying it: cp. 70 f., and n. on 554. The sense must be either:— <quote lang="en">"And what is <emph>the pledge</emph> which thou wouldst have fixed (1) in <emph>his</emph> mind?"</quote>— <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> <quote lang="en">"What is it that thou wouldst tell him in confidence, under his pledge of secrecy?"</quote>—or else (2) <quote lang="en">"in <emph>thy</emph> mind?"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> <quote lang="en">"what promise wouldst thou obtain from him before death?"</quote> Here (2) is recommended by the fact that the <quote lang="greek">φρήν</quote> is then the same in both vv. Nor is the reply of Oed. (1489) inconsistent with it; since the fulfilment of his promise (580) to Theseus involves a pledge from Theseus to keep the secret (1530). It is, of course, possible that Soph. wrote <foreign lang="greek">ἐμφῆναι ξένῳ</foreign>, or the like: but the vulgate is at least defensible.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1515</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στράψαντα</lemma>. <quote lang="greek">στράπτω</quote> is not extant in classical Attic, but occurs in Apollonius Rhodius (<dateRange authname="-200/-100" from="-200" to="-100">2nd cent. B.C.</dateRange>) and Oppian (<dateRange authname="100/200" from="100" to="200">2nd cent. A.D.</dateRange>), also in an Orphic hymn of uncertain date, and in the Anthology. In cases of this kind we should always recollect how incomplete is our knowledge of the classical Attic vocabulary, and allow for the likelihood that the learned Alexandrian poets had earlier warrant for this or that word which, as it happens, we cannot trace above them. (Cp. on <quote lang="greek">ἀκορέστατος</quote>, 120.) With <quote lang="greek">ἀστράπτω</quote> and <quote lang="greek">στράπτω</quote>, cp. <quote lang="greek">ἀστεροπή</quote> and <quote lang="greek">στεροπή, ἀσπαίρω</quote> and <quote lang="greek">σπαίρω, ἀσταφίς</quote> and <quote lang="greek">σταφίς, ἄσταχυς</quote> and <quote lang="greek">στάχυς</quote>, and many other instances in which the longer form and the shorter both belong to the classical age.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σκήψαντα</lemma> (Forster) is much less forcible: the thought is of the lightningflash breaking forth as a sign in the sky (<quote lang="greek">φλέγει</quote>, 1466), rather than of its descent on earth: and this word would hardly have passed into the MS. <quote lang="greek">στρέψαντα.</quote>

<span class="line-ref">Line 1542</span><p>—<emph>1555</emph> A more splendid dramatic effect than Sophocles has created here could hardly be conceived. Hitherto, throughout the play, Oedipus has been strongly characterised by that timidity in movement, and that sense of physical dependence, which are normal accompaniments of blindness. (Cp. 21, 173 ff., 495 ff., 1206, etc.) Now, suddenly inspired by the Unseen Power which calls him, he becomes the guide of his guides. Now it is they who shrink. Eager and unfaltering, the blind man beckons them on. And so he finally passes from the eyes of the spectators.

That the latter is Doric for <quote lang="greek">βαρυηχεῖ</quote> is confirmed by the fact that the schol. actually uses the latter form in his note; cp. 1663 <quote lang="greek">οὐ στενακτός</quote>. Brunck's <foreign lang="greek">ἀδάματον</foreign> (for MS. <quote lang="greek">ἀδάμαστον</quote>) being certain in 1572, the question then is:—How are the words <foreign lang="greek">μήτ’ ἐπιπόνω μήτ)</foreign> to be so corrected that they shall metrically answer to <foreign lang="greek">ἀδάματο—ν</foreign>? The absence of the <foreign lang="greek">ι</foreign> subscript agrees with the hypothesis of an original <foreign lang="greek">μητ’ ἐπιπόνως</foreign>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1584</span><p> The MS. words <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἀεὶ</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">αἰεὶ</foreign>) certainly conceal a fault, which is perhaps very old. We cannot supply <quote lang="greek">χρόνον</quote> (<quote lang="en">"for ever"</quote>). Nor do I see how <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἀεὶ βίοτον</foreign> could mean, <quote lang="en">"the life of all his days"</quote> (<quote lang="en">"What life, life-long, was his,"</quote> Whitelaw). The schol. gives nothing better than a fatuous interpretation of <quote lang="greek">τὸν ἀεὶ βίοτον</quote> as <quote lang="greek">τὸ μακρὸν γῆρας</quote>. The first question is whether the fault is confined to <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign>. (1) If so, <foreign lang="greek">τόν</foreign> being sound, <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign> (<emph>a</emph>) may conceal another adv., or an adj.: as <quote lang="greek">ἄρτι, ἄβιον, αἰνόν, ἀλαόν, ἀτυχῆ</quote>. Of these <quote lang="greek">ἀλαόν</quote> is perh. least unsatisfactory. It should not be too hastily assumed that the poet would have shunned a fourfold <quote lang="greek">‐ον</quote>. Or (<emph>b</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">ἀεί</foreign> may have arisen from some ancient mutilation of <foreign lang="greek">ἄνδρα</foreign>. The very simplicity of <foreign lang="greek">κεῖνον τὸν ἄνδρα</foreign> has a solemnity which is not unfitting here; and to my mind this solution has greater probability than perhaps many would concede to it at first sight. (2) If <foreign lang="greek">τόν</foreign> is corrupt, then there are these possibilities. (<emph>a</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἀεί</foreign> may conceal one word, such (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) as <quote lang="greek">πάνοιζυν</quote>, <quote lang="en">"all-wretched,"</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 49" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Cho.</title> 49</bibl>. (<emph>b</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">τόν</foreign> may have been inserted to supply a lost syllable: though against this is the fact that our MSS. often tolerate lame trimeters. This view suits (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ἐκεῖνον ἄρτι</foreign>, or Hermann's <foreign lang="greek">κεῖνόν γ’ ἐσαιεί</foreign> (to which, however, the <foreign lang="greek">γ’</foreign> is fatal). (3) It is vain to speculate on the possibility of corruptions extending beyond <foreign lang="greek">τὸν ἀεί</foreign>. The words <foreign lang="greek">βίοτον ἐξεπίστασο</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">κεῖνον</foreign> (or <quote lang="greek">ἐκεῖνον</quote>) are <foreign lang="la">prima facie</foreign> sound. Thus (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) to suggest <quote lang="greek">ἐκεῖνον ἐξεπίστασ’ εἰσαεὶ βίον</quote> would be unwarrantable. We seek to amend, not to re-write.

Hence the name of that place may have been associated in the Athenian mind with the idea of removal to another world. <quote lang="greek">Θορικός</quote> (so Her., Xen., etc.: <quote lang="greek">Θόρικος</quote> schol.) was a town and deme of Attica, belonging to the tribe <quote lang="greek">Ἀκαμαντίς</quote>, on the S.E. coast, about 6 miles N. of Sunium, and 42 S.E. of Colonus. It was reckoned among the twelve towns of the old Attic dodecapolis, and, to judge by the ruins, was a considerable place down to late times (Leake, <title>Demi</title> II. 17—22). If <quote lang="greek">Θορικίου</quote> is unsound, the familiarity of <quote lang="greek">Θορίκιοι</quote> as a deme-name may have suggested it. Schneidewin's <foreign lang="greek">τρικορύφου</foreign> rests on the schol. to 57: <quote lang="greek">καί τις τῶν χρησμοποιῶν φησί· <quote><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="hexameter"><l>Βοιωτοὶ δ’ ἵπποιο ποτιστείχουσι Κολωνόν,</l>

<p>The power and beauty of this passage are in no way lessened for us because we know nothing of the basin or the stone, the tree or the tomb. Rather it might be said that the very fact of our ignorance illustrates the spirit in which these details are introduced. Their significance is essentially local: <quote lang="greek">ταῦτα γνώριμα τοῖς ἐγχωρίοις</quote> (schol.). They show us how the blind man, who had never been at Colonus before, placed himself at precisely the due point in the midst of its complex sanctities. The god made him as one who had the most intimate and minute knowledge of the ground.

The obvious <foreign lang="greek">ἔρωτος</foreign> (<quote lang="en">"desire"</quote>) should not be too lightly rejected: cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 436" valid="yes">436.</bibl>

<span class="line-ref">Line 1632</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁρκίαν</lemma>, the conjecture of P. N. Papageorgius, is the best emendation of the certainly corrupt <foreign lang="greek">ἀρχαίαν</foreign>. It gives exactly what we need, viz. such an epithet for <foreign lang="greek">πίστιν</foreign> as marks the special solemnity of the pledge. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Laws 843A" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Legg.</title> 843A</bibl> <quote lang="greek">φιλίαν τε καὶ ἔχθραν ἔνορκον</quote></cit>. The occurrence of <quote lang="greek">ὅρκιος</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1637" valid="yes">1637</bibl> cannot be made an objection (cp. <ref targOrder="U" target="cl544">544 n.</ref>); on the contrary, it rather confirms <quote lang="greek">ὁρκίαν</quote> here. Theseus did just what Oedipus asked.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀρχαίαν</lemma> has been explained as follows: —(1) <quote lang="en">"Thy right hand, <emph>that time-honoured pledge.</emph>"</quote> I agree with Campbell and Bellermann that this is the best version: indeed, I should be disposed to say, the <emph>only</emph> sound one. But in such a context we surely want something more than so general an epithet. (2) Thy pledge, <quote lang="en">"<emph>which some day will be old</emph>,"</quote> <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> which you are sure to observe permanently. Herm. supports this extraordinary <quote lang="en">"prolepsis"</quote> by <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 579" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title> 579</bibl>, where, however, <quote lang="greek">ἀρχαῖον γάνος</quote> is rather, <quote lang="en">"the traditional ornament"</quote> of temples (spoils): unless we should read (<quote lang="greek">δόμοις</quote>) <quote lang="greek">ἀρχαίοις</quote>. (3) <quote lang="en">"A pledge of such good faith as you have always observed"</quote> (<foreign lang="la">fides perpetuo apud te usu sacrata</foreign>, Ellendt). (4) A modification of the last view refers <quote lang="greek">ἀρχαίαν</quote> to v. 631, as=<quote lang="en">"the pledge given at the beginning (of our intercourse)."</quote> It is impossible to accept any one of these interpretations.</p>
<p>(1) Two other conjectures claim notice. <foreign lang="greek">ἀρθμίαν</foreign> (Wecklein)=<quote lang="en">"in a friendly compact."</quote> Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 16.427" valid="yes"><title>Od.</title> 16.427</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οἱ δ’ ἡμῖν ἄρθμιοι ἦσαν</quote></cit>, <quote lang="en">"they were in amity with us."</quote> In <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

But this epithet does not strengthen <quote lang="greek">πίστιν</quote>. (2) <foreign lang="greek">ἀρκίαν</foreign> (L. Schmidt)=<quote lang="en">"sure."</quote> The only support for this is the epic phrase <quote lang="greek">μισθὸς ἄρκιος</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλύπητον</lemma>, the MS. reading, is incomparably better than the variant <foreign lang="greek">ἀλάμπετον</foreign>, which I believe to have been merely one of those conjectures in which the old transcribers and commentators sometimes indulged. By <foreign lang="greek">ἀλύπητον</foreign> the poet meant, <quote lang="en">"<emph>without pain</emph>"</quote> (to Oed.); though it does not follow that he used the word with definite consciousness of an active sense.  Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The passive sense, <quote lang="en">"not pained,"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, where all earthly pain is over,—seems less suitable. Pollux 3. 98 says, <quote lang="greek">Πλάτων δὲ καὶ ἀλύπητος ἔχει, ὥσπερ καὶ Σοφοκλῆς ἀλύπητον</quote>: where, since Plat. has the word only in the place just cited, <quote lang="greek">ἀλύπητος</quote> should perh. be <quote lang="greek">ἀλυπήτως</quote>. The second ref. seems to indicate this passage, rather than <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλάμπετον</lemma> (instead of <quote lang="greek">ἀλαμπές</quote>) is not attested for the classical age, though it occurs in later poetry (<title>Anthol.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὐ τὸ μέν, ἄλλο δὲ μή</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">μή</quote>, instead of <quote lang="greek">οὐ</quote>, because it goes with the inf. <quote lang="greek">στενάζειν</quote>), <quote lang="en">"not in <emph>one</emph> respect merely, with the exception of some other"</quote>; not merely <emph>partially.</emph> This phrase is frequent where the notion of <emph>completeness</emph> or <emph>universality</emph> is to be brought out with greater emphasis than would be given by the mere use of <quote lang="greek">πᾶς</quote> or like words. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

That <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> was an error for <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> had already been surmised by some old corrector (see cr. n.). Hermann defended <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> by taking it with <foreign lang="greek">ἔχρῃζες</foreign> as=<quote lang="en">"would that thou hadst not wished"</quote>—an unheardof construction (cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl540">540</ref>). He took <quote lang="greek">ἔρημος ὧδέ … μοι</quote> as=<quote lang="en">"lonely, just as thou wast, for me,"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> in his wanderings before he had found Attic friends; since, if he had died while still alone with her, she could have given him burial herself.—With <foreign lang="greek">ὤμοι</foreign> render:—<quote lang="en">"Ah me, it was thy <emph>wish</emph> to die in a strange land (and so far thy death is well): but thus (by this manner of death) thou hast died <emph>forlorn in regard to me</emph>"</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> ethic dat.). She means, <quote lang="en">"I have had no opportunity of rendering thee the due rites, and now I do not know the place of thy grave, so as to make the <quote lang="greek">ἐναγίσματα"</quote> at it.</quote> Hence her passionate desire to find his grave (1724 ff.), which Theseus with difficulty allays by reminding her of his solemn promise (1760). The preparatory offices rendered at 1602 f. could not be viewed as taking the place of a daughter's tribute to the dead. Like 1410, this trait serves to recall the special manifestation of her piety in the earlier play.—Not merely:—<quote lang="en">"It was your wish; but it was sad for me to see you die <emph>forlorn</emph>,"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> in exile. Though <quote lang="greek">ἐπὶ ξένης</quote>, he was <emph>not</emph> in this sense <foreign lang="greek">ἔρημος</foreign>,—he who, in his own words, had <quote lang="en">"Athens and all her people"</quote> for his friends (772).—Cp. 1705 <quote lang="greek">ἆς ἔχρῃζε...ἔθανε</quote>. The repetition of one phrase in no way justifies Dindorf's rash hypothesis of interpolation here (see cr. n.). Here, the wish is connected with a painful thought; there, with a soothing one. Mention of the wish itself might most naturally recur in a lament.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1713</span><span class="line-ref">Line 1713</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὤμοι</lemma> is Wecklein's correction of <foreign lang="greek">ἰὼ μή</foreign>. That <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> was an error for <foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> had already been surmised by some old corrector (see cr. n.). Hermann defended <foreign lang="greek">μή</foreign> by taking it with <foreign lang="greek">ἔχρῃζες</foreign> as=<quote lang="en">"would that thou hadst not wished"</quote>—an unheardof construction (cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl540">540</ref>). He took <quote lang="greek">ἔρημος ὧδέ … μοι</quote> as=<quote lang="en">"lonely, just as thou wast, for me,"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> in his wanderings before he had found Attic friends; since, if he had died while still alone with her, she could have given him burial herself.—With <foreign lang="greek">ὤμοι</foreign> render:—<quote lang="en">"Ah me, it was thy <emph>wish</emph> to die in a strange land (and so far thy death is well): but thus (by this manner of death) thou hast died <emph>forlorn in regard to me</emph>"</quote> (<foreign lang="greek">μοι</foreign> ethic dat.). She means, <quote lang="en">"I have had no opportunity of rendering thee the due rites, and now I do not know the place of thy grave, so as to make the <quote lang="greek">ἐναγίσματα"</quote> at it.</quote> Hence her passionate desire to find his grave (1724 ff.), which Theseus with difficulty allays by reminding her of his solemn promise (1760). The preparatory offices rendered at 1602 f. could not be viewed as taking the place of a daughter's tribute to the dead. Like 1410, this trait serves to recall the special manifestation of her piety in the earlier play.—Not merely:—<quote lang="en">"It was your wish; but it was sad for me to see you die <emph>forlorn</emph>,"</quote>—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> in exile. Though <quote lang="greek">ἐπὶ ξένης</quote>, he was <emph>not</emph> in this sense <foreign lang="greek">ἔρημος</foreign>,—he who, in his own words, had <quote lang="en">"Athens and all her people"</quote> for his friends (772).—Cp. 1705 <quote lang="greek">ἆς ἔχρῃζε...ἔθανε</quote>. The repetition of one phrase in no way justifies Dindorf's rash hypothesis of interpolation here (see cr. n.). Here, the wish is connected with a painful thought; there, with a soothing one. Mention of the wish itself might most naturally recur in a lament.

<p>In these verses the utterances usually assigned to Antigone all turn on her anxiety as to a refuge, and her desire to return to Thebes. Such feelings, at this moment, are more in harmony with the character of Ismene (cp. 1735). Antigone is at present absorbed in the yearning to visit her father's tomb, or at least the spot where she last saw him alive (1724). When Theseus appears, it is this wish which she instantly presses on him. Only when it has been put aside does she think of a return to Thebes (1769).</p>
<p>Ought we, then, to read <quote lang="greek">ΙΣ.</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ΑΝ.</quote> throughout vv. 1737—1750? This has been suggested by Bergk. I may observe that the Laur. MS. leaves the question open. At 1730 it has <quote lang="greek">ΑΝ.</quote> before <quote lang="greek">τί τόδ’ ἐπέπληξας</quote>. After that, there is no indication of any person, but only short lines (-), until at 1741 <quote lang="greek">ΑΝ.</quote> again stands before <quote lang="greek">φρονῶ</quote>. The next words, <quote lang="greek">τί δῆθ’</quote> etc., have <quote lang="greek">ΧΟ.</quote> before them: but after that no person is indicated till 1751, where <quote lang="greek">ΧΟ.</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">ΘΗ.</quote>) is erroneously placed before <quote lang="greek">παύετε</quote>.</p>
<p>I am disposed to think that Sophocles wrote the words for Ismene, but that the fourth-actor difficulty had led to a fluctuation of stage-practice, which helps to account for the ambiguity of the MS. tradition. See the note on the Dramatis Personae. If the part of Ismene, <emph>after</emph> v. 509, was ever taken by a <quote lang="greek">κωφὸν πρόσωπον</quote>, there may then have been a wish to keep her part in this scene as small as possible. Similarly at 1689 ff. there is a doubt as to which sister ought to have the words <quote lang="greek">οὐ κάτοιδα...βιωτός</quote>.

This, however, is improbable, and also injurious to the point of v. 1740. Further, with <quote lang="greek">ἀπεφύγετον</quote>, v. 1740 has a construction which makes the order of the words harsh, viz.: —<quote lang="en">"Ye escaped,"</quote></p>

It may be added that, with <foreign lang="greek">ἀπεφύγετον</foreign>, v. 1740  is somewhat pointless, since the mere allusion in <foreign lang="greek">τὰ σφῷν</foreign> to Creon's attempt is too vague to answer Antigone's <foreign lang="greek">τί</foreign>; ("<emph>what</emph> did we escape?").

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θρῆνον</lemma>, not <foreign lang="greek">θρήνων</foreign>, is clearly right. The 2nd per. <emph>sing.</emph> imper., <foreign lang="greek">παῦε</foreign>, is the only part of <quote lang="greek">παύω</quote> which is used intransitively by the classical Attic writers,—being, in fact, an exclamation (like our <quote lang="en">"<emph>stop!</emph>"</quote>), though sometimes joined with a gen. (<quote lang="greek">παῦε τοῦ λόγου</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Frogs 580" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Ran.</title> 580</bibl>). No weight can be given to the fact that L has <foreign lang="greek">θρήνων</foreign> here, since it has it also in 1778 (see cr. n.).

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ξύν’ ἀπόκειται</lemma> for the MS. <foreign lang="greek">ξυ^ναπόκειται</foreign> is (I think) right.

<p>Antigone suggests that she and Ismene may yet be in time to plead with their two brothers, and so to avert the doom of mutual destruction pronounced on them by their father <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1373" valid="yes">(1373)</bibl>. Thus the close of this drama is linked by the poet with the beginning of his earlier <title>Antigone</title>, which opens at a moment just after the deaths of the brothers. The sisters are then living at Thebes, where Creon has succeeded to the throne. An additional pathos is lent to Antigone's part there by the suggestion here of a previous intercession.

<p>After <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1776" valid="yes">1776</bibl> the MS. <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> must be struck out, as Hermann saw, so that the anapaests spoken by Theseus may end with a paroemiac. When anapaests spoken by the Chorus close a tragedy, these always form a system separate from the anapaests (if any) which precede them. This was plainly necessary, in order to avoid an unduly abrupt ending. But if we point thus:— <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς χάριν· οὐ δεῖ μ’ ἀποκάμνειν</foreign>, the asyndeton has a crude effect. Hence, placing only a comma after <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς χάριν</foreign>, we should render:— "Not only will I do these things, but <emph>in all things</emph> which I am likely to do for your advantage (etc.) I must not <emph>wax weary.</emph>" The sentence begins as if the constr. was to be <foreign lang="greek">δράσω καὶ τάδε καὶ πάντα</foreign>. But the new verb added at the end requires <foreign lang="greek">πάντα</foreign> to be acc. with <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκάμνειν</foreign>. (Cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl351">351</ref>.)

<p>Antigone suggests that she and Ismene may yet be in time to plead with their two brothers, and so to avert the doom of mutual destruction pronounced on them by their father <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1373" valid="yes">(1373)</bibl>. Thus the close of this drama is linked by the poet with the beginning of his earlier <title>Antigone</title>, which opens at a moment just after the deaths of the brothers. The sisters are then living at Thebes, where Creon has succeeded to the throne. An additional pathos is lent to Antigone's part there by the suggestion here of a previous intercession. In Aesch. <title>Theb.</title> it is the Chorus (of Theban maidens) that endeavours to dissuade Eteocles from going to meet his brother <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

<p>After <foreign lang="greek">οὐ</foreign> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1776" valid="yes">1776</bibl> the MS. <foreign lang="greek">γάρ</foreign> must be struck out, as Hermann saw, so that the anapaests spoken by Theseus may end with a paroemiac. When anapaests spoken by the Chorus close a tragedy, these always form a system separate from the anapaests (if any) which precede them. This was plainly necessary, in order to avoid an unduly abrupt ending. But if we point thus:— <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς χάριν· οὐ δεῖ μ’ ἀποκάμνειν</foreign>, the asyndeton has a crude effect. Hence, placing only a comma after <foreign lang="greek">πρὸς χάριν</foreign>, we should render:— "Not only will I do these things, but <emph>in all things</emph> which I am likely to do for your advantage (etc.) I must not <emph>wax weary.</emph>" The sentence begins as if the constr. was to be <foreign lang="greek">δράσω καὶ τάδε καὶ πάντα</foreign>. But the new verb added at the end requires <foreign lang="greek">πάντα</foreign> to be acc. with <foreign lang="greek">ἀποκάμνειν</foreign>. (Cp. on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl351">351</ref>.)

<p>Though the neut. pl. <foreign lang="greek">πλείω</foreign> <emph>alone</emph> is sometimes adverbial, there seems to be no instance of <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ πλείω</foreign> as=<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ πλέον</foreign>: indeed, such a phrase is hardly conceivable.  <foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ</foreign> must therefore belong to <foreign lang="greek">ἐγείρετε</foreign>: for the tmesis cp. <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1689">on 1689</ref>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1779</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔχει … κῦρος</lemma>, lit., "have validity," = <foreign lang="greek">κεκύρωται</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">sancta sunt.</foreign> Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Most commentators prefer (1). But (2) seems more fitting at the conclusion. The last soothing words of the Chorus convey a precept of resignation to the divine will.

<p>Fr. Ritter rejects the last three verses, as he rejects the choral <foreign lang="la">clausulae</foreign> of all the other six plays (<bibl default="NO"><title>Philol.</title> XVII. 422-436</bibl>): cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1524" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1524</bibl> cr. n. Here, at least, there is not a shadow of ground for the suspicion. It did not require a Sophocles to write <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1777" valid="yes">vv. 1777-1779</bibl>, but the burden of proof rests with those who deny that he wrote them.</p></div3></div>
