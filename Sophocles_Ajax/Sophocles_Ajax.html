This series ranged over the whole course of the ten years' war, from its earliest incidents, as told in the <title>Cypria</title>, down to the fall of the city, as told in the <title>Iliupersis.</title> The <title>Philoctetes</title> is connected with this series, but the <title>Ajax</title> is the only remaining piece which actually belongs to it. The story is taken from sources later than the <title>Iliad</title>, but the conception of the hero, though modified by that later legend, is fundamentally Homeric.</p>
<p>In the <title>Iliad</title>, Ajax, the son of Telamon, comes to Troy <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Ajax of the <title>Iliad.</title></note> from Salamis with twelve ships, and is stationed on the extreme left of the army, at the east end of the camp,—as Achilles holds the corresponding post of honour on the right<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 11.7" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 11. 7—9.</bibl></note>. He is an independent chief,—subject only to the allegiance which all the chiefs owe to the Captain General, Agamemnon. There is no reference to his descent from Aeacus; nor is there anything that connects him especially with Athens<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In the Catalogue only two verses are given to Ajax, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

The second verse is absent from our best MSS., as it was from some of the editions known to Quintilian (<bibl default="NO" n="Quint. 5.11.40">5. 11 § 40</bibl>). Aristotle (<bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Rh. 1.15.13" valid="yes"><title>Rhet.</title> I. 15 § 13</bibl>) alludes to it as having been quoted by the Athenians in support of their claim to Salamis, and the interpolation must be at least as old as the date of their controversy with the Megarians (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> <dateRange authname="-600/-595" from="-600" to="-595">600—595 B.C.</dateRange>), whether the author was Solon or not. The Alexandrian critics rejected the verse, pointing out that Ajax, on the extreme left, had the Thessalians for his neighbours on the right (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 13.681" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 13. 681</bibl>), while Odysseus, at the middle of the camp, was next to the Athenians (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

If, however, it belonged to the genuine text, it must originally have been followed by more than one verse relating to Ajax, who was too important to be dismissed so curtly.</note>.

This is true to the picture of him in the <title>Iliad.</title> Once, indeed, after he has uttered a defiant and menacing challenge, Hector calls him ‘a blunderer, a clumsy braggart<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

TRO 2.1.12"><title>Troilus and Cressida</title>, 2. 1. 12</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Shak. TRO 3.3.139">3. 3. 139</bibl>.</note>.’ In another place, however,—when he agrees, at the herald's suggestion, to break off his combat with Hector, though he was having the best of it,—his chivalrous opponent recognises Ajax as one to whom the gods have given, not only ‘stature and might,’ but ‘understanding<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

It is he who perceives when the moment has come for ceasing to press the inexorable hero. ‘Let us go hence; for I do not think that the end of our message can be gained by this mission.’ He points out to his companions that it seems hopeless to move Achilles at present: and then, turning to Achilles himself, he addresses him in words of frank reproach, but also of friendly appeal and of cordial good-will<note anchored="yes" n="6" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<p>One trait, however, marks an important difference between the Homeric and the later conception. In the play of Sophocles Ajax appears as one who has offended Athena by the presumptuous self-confidence with which he has rejected divine aid in war. There is no trace of this in the <title>Iliad.</title> While he is arming for the combat with Hector, he exhorts the Greeks to pray that Zeus may help him<note anchored="yes" n="7" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 7.193" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 7. 193</bibl> ff.</note>. In the battle at the ships, after splendid deeds of valour, he retreats when he perceives, with a thrill of awe, that, for the time, the gods are against him<note anchored="yes" n="8" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 16.119" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 16. 119</bibl><quote lang="greek"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="hexameter"><l>γνῶ δ’ Αἴας κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονα ῥίγησέν τε</l>
<l>ἔργα θεῶν</l></lg></quote></cit>.</note>. During the battle over the body of  Patroclus, when a thick mist has fallen on the field, his prayer for light breathes reverent submission to the will of Zeus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 17.645" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 17. 645</bibl> ff.</note>.</p>
<p>Such is the Ajax of the <title>Iliad</title>; a mighty champion of the Greeks in their sorest need; a man of good sense and good feeling, sparing of words, but able to speak wisely in season; loyal to his friends; straightforward and unselfish; frankly conscious of his strength, but placing his reliance on the help of the gods, and yielding, even in the fiercest struggle, to revelations of their mind.</p>
<p>A contest between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles, resulting in the defeat and suicide of Ajax, is first mentioned in the <title>Odyssey</title><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.543" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 11. 543-547:</bibl> <quote lang="greek"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="hexamter"><l>οἴη δ’ Αἴαντος ψυχὴ Τελαμωνιάδαο</l>

<l>παῖδες δὲ Τρώων δίκασαν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη</l></lg></quote></cit>. On the last verse (547) the schol. (H) says, <quote lang="greek">ἀθετεῖ Ἀρίσταρχος</quote>. It is not known on what grounds he rejected it; whether because the verse was absent from some copies; or because it conflicted with some other version of the matter which he regarded as having better authority; or for both reasons. The context itself affords no reason for suspecting this particular verse; on the contrary, the mention of the person who <emph>proposed</emph> the prize (<quote lang="greek">ἔθηκε</quote>) is most naturally followed by a mention of the persons who made the award; and the passage would be maimed by the omission. W. Christ holds that Aristarchus was mistaken in condemning verse 547, and that it represents an early version of the story, probably that given by Arctînus in the <title>Aethiopis</title> (<title>Jahr. f. Philol.</title> 1881 p. 444): see also Kirchhoff (<title>Hom. Odyss.</title> p. 231); and K. F. Ameis <foreign lang="la">ad loc.</foreign> The whole passage relating to the contest of the arms may, no doubt, be later than other parts of the <quote lang="greek">Νέκυια</quote>.</note>, where the sullen shade of the injured hero refuses to hold converse with the victor. It was the goddess Thetis who set her son's arms for a prize; ‘the judges were the children of the Trojans and Pallas Athena.’

<span class="line-ref">Line 2</span><p>The whole passage <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Cyclic epics. The <title>Aethiopis.</title></note> evidently presupposes some well-known work or works in which the contest for the arms had been related more at length. The scholiast says that ‘the story comes from the Cyclic poets<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. H on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.547" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 11. 547</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἡ δὲ ἱστορία ἐκ τῶν κυκλικῶν</quote>.</note>.’ There are two poems, and two only, which are known to have contained that story. One is the  <title>Aethiopis</title>, by Arctînus of Miletus, which may be placed about <date authname="-776" value="-776">776 B.C.</date>  The other is the <title>Little Iliad</title>, which in later antiquity was commonly (though not universally) ascribed to Lesches<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As Carl Robert has pointed out in <title>Bild und Lied</title> (‘Arktinos und Lesches,’ pp. 222 ff.), the claim of Lesches is subject to much doubt. Hellanicus, himself a Lesbian, attributed the <title>Little Iliad</title> to Cinaethon of Lacedaemon, according to the scholiast on   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Tro. 821" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Tro.</title> 821</bibl>; where Thestorides of Phocis and Diodorus of Erythrae are mentioned as other writers to whom the poem had been attributed—while Lesches is not even named. The scholiast probably derived this statement from the Alexandrian Lysimachus, a learned mythographer, whose work entitled <quote lang="greek">Νόστοι</quote> is often quoted.</note>, of Pyrrha, near Mitylene, and of which the approximate date is <date authname="-700" value="-700">700 B.C.</date></p>
<p>In the <title>Aethiopis</title>, which contained the death of Achilles, Ajax played a foremost part in rescuing the corpse from the Trojans— an episode imitated from the fight over the body of Patroclus in the <title>Iliad.</title> As to the manner in which Arctînus conceived the contest for the arms, only two details are known. (1) After the award, Podaleirius—the physician, skilled in diagnosis of obscure ailments, as his brother Machaon was the great surgeon—perceived a fierce light in the eyes of Ajax, and a weight upon his spirit, which were the precursors of the end:—</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">ὅς ῥα καὶ Αἴαντος πρῶτος μάθε χωομένοιο ὄμματά τ’ ἀστράπτοντα βαρυνόμενόν τε νόημα</quote><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 11.515" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 11. 515</bibl>(referring to the skill of Machaon in surgery): <quote lang="greek">τοῦτο ἔοικε καὶ Ἀρκτῖνος ἐν Ἰλίου πορθήσει νομίζειν ἐν οἷς φησιν</quote> [here he quotes eight verses from Arctînus, on the skill of Machaon and Podaleirius respectively, ending with the two verses given above]. Arctînus was the author of two poems: (1) the <quote lang="greek">Αἰθιοπίς</quote>, which ended with the contest between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms: (2) the <quote lang="greek">Ἰλίου πέρσις</quote>, which (like the <title>Little Iliad</title>) probably included the healing of Philoctetes. The scholiast quotes these verses as being <quote lang="greek">ἐν Ἰλίου πορθήσει</quote>. It has been supposed that they occurred in connection with the contest for the arms, and that therefore the scholiast ought to have said <quote lang="greek">ἐν Αἰθιοπίδι</quote>. But it is also possible that the scholiast is right—that the verses came from the <title>Iliupersis</title>, and had to do with the healing of Philoctetes. Certainly, as Mr Monro has remarked (<title>Journ. Hellen. Stud.</title> vol. v. p. 29), ‘the two lines about Ajax have rather the appearance of a parenthesis.’ If, however, the skill of Podaleirius was thus illustrated by a glance backward at the insight which he had formerly shown with regard to Ajax, we can scarcely avoid supposing that in the <title>Aethiopis</title>, when the contest for the arms was being related, this observation by Podaleirius had already been mentioned. The parenthesis would be clumsy and out of place, if the fact was being noticed for the first time. Indeed, such an allusion might well suggest the inference that in the <title>Aethiopis</title> the contest for the arms, and the effect of his defeat upon Ajax, were described with some fulness.</note>.  (2) Arctînus described Ajax as killing himself ‘about dawn<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. I. 4" valid="yes">Pind. <title>Isthm.</title> 4.(3.) 58</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὁ γὰρ τὴν Αἰθιοπίδα γράφων περὶ τὸν ὄρθρον φησὶ τὸν Αἴαντα ἑαυτὸν ἀνελεῖν</quote>.</note>’— doubtless on the morning after the award. There is no reason to think that Arctînus mentioned that delusion of Ajax by Athena which caused his slaughter of the cattle. The scanty evidence rather suggests that the rage in the hero's soul was not expressed in any deed of violence, but that he passed in seclusion, perhaps within his tent, the few hours of darkness between his defeat and his death<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">We have just seen that, according to Arctînus, it was the acute physician Podaleirius who ‘first’ detected the symptoms of anger and deep mental trouble in Ajax. This clearly implies that Ajax, though with rage in his soul, retained his self-command. What the physician was ‘the first’ to see, others saw only in the light of the tragic event—the hero's suicide, which so quickly ensued. So, at least, I understand the force of <quote lang="greek">πρῶτος μάθε</quote>. The antithesis might be, of course, with the later perception caused in others by an <emph>outbreak</emph> of fury on the part of Ajax: but, in connection with the fact that he was here represented as dying almost immediately after the award, this seems less probable.</note>. It is highly probable that the older and simpler form of the Ajax-myth knew nothing of his insane onslaught on the cattle, by which Athena averted his vengeance from the Greek chiefs. The motive of his suicide, in this older version, seems to have been simply resentment at the award— not that feeling combined with a sense of disgrace incurred by his own action. Such is certainly the impression given by the passage in the <title>Odyssey</title><note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.543" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 11. 543</bibl> ff.: not merely because it is silent respecting madness and outrage, but because it implies (556 f.) that Ajax had died, like Achilles, in unclouded renown —without having done anything to offend the Greeks, who in the play of Sophocles (v. 726) threaten to stone Teucer, as ‘the kinsman of the maniac, the plotter against the host.’</note>. It is given also by Pindar, when he says, ‘The Danaoi paid court to Odysseus by secret votes, and Ajax, robbed of the golden arms, wrestled with death<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Pind.

<p>There is another point, however, in which it seems probable that they diverged. According to Pindar, the Greek chiefs were the judges in the contest for the arms. This account, which Sophocles follows, is fitted to win sympathy for Ajax, who appears as a victim of jealousy and of ingratitude on the part of men who had the best reason to know that he was second only to Achilles. But the <title>Odyssey</title> testifies to that other version according to which the judges were ‘the children of the Trojans and Pallas Athena.’ The words of the scholiast<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. H on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.547." valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 11. 547.</bibl>Eustathius (p. 1698) cannot, I think, be regarded as a witness of independent authority on this point, though that has sometimes been assumed. Commenting on <quote lang="greek">παῖδες δὲ Τρώων δίκασαν</quote>, he says:—<quote lang="greek">ἰστέον δὲ ὅτι</quote> (1) <quote lang="greek"><emph>οἱ μὲν</emph> ἁπλοϊκώτερόν φασι Τρῶας καὶ Ἀθηνᾶν δικάσαι Ὀδυσσεῖ καὶ Αἴαντι περὶ τῶν Ἀχιλλέως ὅπλων ἐρίζουσι, καὶ δὴ καὶ Κόϊντος</quote> [ <bibl default="NO" n="Q.

H on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.547" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Od.</title> 11. 547</bibl>, to which he adds nothing new. Thus he distinguishes two versions. (1) That in which the judges are simply ‘<emph>the Trojans</emph>,’ with Athena—as in the <title>Odyssey.</title> He names Quintus Smyrnaeus in connection with this version—and for a reason which can, I think, be perceived; Quintus makes Nestor say, <quote lang="greek">τοὔνεκα Τρωσὶν ἐφῶμεν ἐΰφροσι τήνδε δικάσσαι κ.τ.λ.</quote> (5. 157). Eustathius noticed or remembered this,—but not that, by <quote lang="greek">Τρωσίν</quote>, the Nestor of Quintus meant the Trojan prisoners in the camp (as he presently explains, v. 160). (2) The version given by ‘others’ (<quote lang="greek">ἕτεροι</quote>）—in which <emph>the Trojan prisoners</emph> judged— was manifestly known to Eustathius only from the scholium on the <title>Odyssey</title>, which he reproduces.</note> there deserve attention:—‘The story is from the Cyclic poets. Agamemnon, on his guard against seeming to favour either of the competitors for the arms of Achilles, brought some Trojan prisoners, and asked them by which of the two heroes they had been more injured,’ etc. There is no reason to doubt that the scholiast knew of this account as given in some poem (or poems) of the Epic Cycle. There is no warrant for assuming that he invented this statement to explain the verse on which he was commenting. But the <title>Aethiopis</title> and the <title>Little Iliad</title> are, so far as we know, the only Cyclic poems to which his allusion could refer. And in the <title>Little Iliad</title> the award of the arms was decided, not by Trojan prisoners in the Greek camp, but (as will be seen presently) by Trojan opinion reported from Troy itself. Presumably, then, it was in the <title>Aethiopis</title> that the Trojan prisoners acted as judges. Since that poem dated from the  earlier part of the eighth century (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 776 B.C.), the verse in the Nekyia of the <title>Odyssey</title>, <quote lang="greek">παῖδες δὲ Τρώων δίκασαν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη</quote>, may have been founded upon it. The Nekyia is, in great part, older, probably, than 800 B.C., but unquestionably received some additions in the course of the eighth and seventh centuries. It is not necessary, however, to suppose that the Nekyia was here indebted to the <title>Aethiopis.</title> Both may have used some older source now unknown. When the Homeric poet associates ‘Pallas Athena’ with the Trojan judges, he need not be understood as conceiving that she actually presided over the award,—as in the <title>Eumenides</title> she presides at the first session of the Areiopagus,—but merely that she influenced the minds of the arbiters.

The <title>Aethiopis</title> was a grave epic, more in the temper of the <title>Iliad</title>; while the other poem had more affinity to the <title>Odyssey</title>, more of the lighter Ionian vein, and a larger element of romance. The contest for the arms was managed in a way which indicates the desire to avoid imitation of some earlier poet who had referred the award to the Trojan captives. By Nestor's advice, the Greeks send spies to the walls of Troy, in the hope that they may overhear some Trojan comments on the rival Greek heroes. The spies are fortunate. At that very moment two Trojan maidens are discussing Ajax and Odysseus. One of them deems Ajax the braver, since he carried the corpse of Achilles out of the fray. The other, inspired by Athena, reproves her;—‘even a woman can bear a burden, when it is laid on her,—but she cannot fight’; —and added, doubtless, that it was Odysseus who had protected the retreat. The Greek chiefs, on hearing the report of their messengers, adjudged the arms to Odysseus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph.

The last line and a half are in the text of Aristophanes. The scholiast designates the author as <quote lang="greek">ὁ τὴν μικρὰν Ἰλιάδα πεποιηκώς</quote>.</note>.

The intervention of Calchas is mentioned by Philostratus <title>Heroic.</title> 11. 3.</note>. Here, then, we have two traits which are distinctive of the story as handled by Sophocles, the onslaught of the mad Ajax on the cattle, and the idea that, after his death, his body was liable to be treated with some degree of penal dishonour. Both these traits, so far as can now be judged, were peculiar to the <title>Little Iliad.</title> In the other version—that indicated in the <title>Odyssey</title> and by Pindar, and probably given by Arctînus—Ajax died guiltless of offence against the Greeks, and received, like Achilles, the spontaneous and uncontested tribute of public mourning.

<span class="line-ref">Line 4</span><p>Before the age of the Attic dramatists, the Ajax <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Ajax and the Aeacidae.</note> legend received some further developments which were probably unknown to the Cyclic poets. One of these was the enrolment of Ajax among the Aeacidae. The <title>Iliad</title> bestows the name of <quote lang="greek">Αἰακίδης</quote> on two persons only,—Peleus, the son, and Achilles, the grandson, of Aeacus.

The cult of Aeacus, son of Zeus, had its chief seat in the island called after his mother, the nymph Aegina. Telamon and Ajax belonged to Salamis. By making Telamon and Peleus brothers, the Aeginetans linked their local hero with the others. This engrafting of Telamon and his son on the Aeacid stock had gained general acceptance before the fifth century B.C. The sculptures of Athena's temple at Aegina date from the period of the Persian wars. On the east pediment Heracles and Telamon were the prominent figures; on the west, Ajax was seen defending the corpse of Achilles. Herodotus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">8. 64 <quote lang="greek">ἔδοξε δέ σφι εὔξασθαι τοῖσι θεοῖσι καὶ ἐπικαλέσασθαι τοὺς Αἰακίδας συμμάχους, ὡς δέ σφι ἔδοξε,...αὐτόθεν μὲν ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος Αἴαντά τε καὶ Τελαμῶνα ἐπεκαλέοντο, ἐπὶ δὲ Αἰακὸν καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους Αἰακίδας νέα ἀπέστελλον ἐς Αἴγιναν</quote>. It has generally been supposed that the ship sent to Aegina was intended to bring sacred images or symbols of the Aeacidae (so  CurtiusE. , <title>Hist. Gr.</title> II. p. 291 Eng. tr.). Stein, however, thinks that the object was merely to make the invocation at Aegina in the proper form; and would similarly explain the presence of the Dioscuri with the Spartan armies ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 5. 75" valid="yes"> Her. 5. 75</bibl>) in a purely spiritual sense.—After the victory, three Phoenician triremes were dedicated by the Greeks to deities who had helped them— one to Poseidon at the Isthmus, one to Athena at Sunium, and one to Ajax at Salamis ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 8. 121" valid="yes"> Her. 8. 121</bibl>).</note> says that when the Greeks had resolved, just before the battle of Salamis, ‘to invoke the Aeacidae as allies,’ they called on Ajax and Telamon to come to them from Salamis itself, but sent a ship to Aegina to summon ‘Aeacus and <emph>the other</emph> Aeacidae’ (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, Peleus, and his son Achilles; Phocus, and his sons Crisus and Panopeus). The passage has an especial interest as showing that, though Ajax had now been thoroughly adopted into the Aeacid cult of Aegina, this had been done without weakening the immemorial tradition which made Salamis his home.</p>
<p>Another addition <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Ajax invulnerable.</note>to the Ajax legend—worthy of notice, since Aeschylus used it—is that which made the hero invulnerable. This was borrowed from the story of Achilles,— which, indeed, influenced at several points the later development of the Ajax-myth: and it served also to connect Ajax with Heracles. In Pindar's fifth Isthmian ode, Heracles, the guest of Telamon at Salamis, prays that his host may have a son, as ‘staunch of frame’ as the hide of the Nemean lion which he himself is wearing<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Pind.

It would be unsafe to found too much upon this notice. Aristotle may have meant, not a particular tragedy entitled <quote lang="greek">Ὅπλων κρίσις</quote>, but, more generally, that episode, as a tragic subject; thus the contest for the arms was certainly included in the <title>Ajax</title> of Theodectes, to which Aristotle more than once alludes in the <title>Rhetoric</title> (see below, § 19). We cannot assume, then, that the version given in the <title>Little Iliad</title> was that which Aeschylus followed. Welcker<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Ueber den Aias des Sophokles</title>, in <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> for 1829, part 3, p. 53.</note> thinks that Aeschylus, following the <title>Aethiopis</title> of Arctînus, made the Trojan captives the judges, and omitted the onslaught of Ajax on the cattle. As to the judges, it is obvious that tragedy could not use the almost playful romance of the <title>Little Iliad</title>, and represent the question as decided by the conversation between the Trojan maidens. One of Welcker's chief reasons for thinking that the captives formed the tribunal is that the <quote lang="greek">Ὅπλων κρίσις</quote> had a second title, namely, <quote lang="greek">Φρύγες</quote>,—these ‘Phrygians’ being the Trojan captives who acted as judges: but this hypothesis as to the second title has no good foundation<note anchored="yes" n="6" place="foot" resp="RCJ">No such second title appears in any one of the five ancient citations of the <quote lang="greek">Οπλων κρίσις</quote> (Nauck, <title>Trag. Frag.</title>, pp. 57 f.).</note>. On this point, then, we must be content to remark that the Trojans appear as the judges not only in the <title>Odyssey</title>, but also in the <title>Heroica</title> of Philostratus, in Quintus Smyrnaeus, and in the <title>Posthomerica</title>  of Tzetzes<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <title>Heroic.</title> 11. 3:  <bibl default="NO" n="Q.

Now, after the age of Attic tragedy, the <title>Aethiopis</title> of Arctînus, like other Cyclic epics, fell into comparative obscurity, so much of the material having been worked up in the more attractive form of drama. The earliest writer, of known date<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The scholia which name or indicate Arctînus, such as those on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Rom.</title> 1. 68.</note>. It would seem that neither Strabo nor Pausanias knew the <title>Aethiopis</title><note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As to Strabo, see Mr Monro in <title>Journ. Hellen. Stud.</title> IV. p. 16, n. 1; as to Pausanias, <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> p. 31, n. 1.</note>. When, therefore, Philostratus (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 235 A.D. ), or Quintus Smyrnaeus (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 450 A.D. ), represents the Trojan captives as the judges, it is much less probable that he derived that version from Arctînus than that he found it in some old writer of wider popularity, such as Aeschylus. It is, of course, a bare possibility that these late writers relied solely on the verse in the <title>Odyssey</title>; but it is very unlikely. I think, therefore, that Welcker's view on this point has much in its favour, although the ground on which he chiefly rests it (the supposed second title of the play) is untenable. With regard to the general treatment of the subject by Aeschylus, one important fact is certain. Ajax and Odysseus argued their respective claims in speeches<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ">This is proved by a fragment of the <quote lang="greek">Ὅπλων κρίσις</quote> ( Aesch. frag. 175, ed. Nauck), manifestly from a speech of Ajax, who taunts Odysseus with being the son of Sisyphus: <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ Ἀντικλείας ἆσσον ἦλθε Σίσυφος, τῆς σῆς λέγω τοι μητρὸς ἥ σ’ ἐγείνατο</quote>.</note>—as they do in Ovid and Quintus Smyrnaeus, and as we know that they did in Theodectes. It may perhaps jar somewhat on our conception of Aeschylus—whose style, as we know it, is so remote from rhetoric of the kind which afterwards became popular at Athens —to imagine him pitting his two heroes against each other in controversial speeches; but there is the trial-scene in the <title>Eumenides</title> to remind us how he could treat a subject of the forensic type without loss of tragic and heroic elevation. The pleading of his Ajax and his Odysseus had probably more resemblance to a controversy in the <title>Iliad</title> than to such an  encounter of wits as Euripides would have provided on a similar occasion.

Hence we learn that the Chorus in the <quote lang="greek">Θρῇσσαι</quote> denounced the part taken by the Atreidae in the award of the arms.</note>. The suicide of Ajax was related by a messenger<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on   <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Aeschylus adopted the legend already mentioned—that Ajax was invulnerable, except at one place (in the side, according to one account), which the lion-hide of Heracles had not covered. The messenger told how, when Ajax first attempted to slay himself, the sword bent against his body, ‘as when a man bends a bow.’ But anon a divine being came to him: she it was who showed him the place at which he must drive in the sword<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on   <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The simple fact that the suicide of Ajax was narrated by an eye-witness, who could describe the circumstances attending it, at once indicates how profoundly Aeschylus must have differed from Sophocles in his treatment of this subject. In the psychology of Ajax, as delineated by Sophocles, we can trace  the growth of those complex feelings which imperiously required that his deed should be done in complete security from the witness of human eye or ear, so that he might be alone with his deliberate thoughts, and with the gods to whom he speaks them.

And, except the <quote lang="greek">Σαλαμίνιαι</quote>, no lost play of Aeschylus is known by name in which Teucer could have been a principal person.</note>. After the death of Ajax, Teucer returns to Salamis, bringing with him the child Eurysaces (confided to his care by Ajax); he is met with reproaches by his father, the aged and lonely Telamon, who blames him for the death of Ajax; and goes forth to found the new Salamis in Cyprus. With regard to the ‘Salaminian women’—the Chorus who gave the title to the play—it is well to remember that, when the protagonist of a Greek play is a man (as Teucer here), but the Chorus female, this regularly denotes that a woman has some important, though secondary, part in the action; as Creüsa, for example, in the  <title>Ion</title>, where the Chorus is formed by her handmaids. The ‘Salaminian women’ stood (we may conjecture) in a like relation to Eriboea, the mother of Ajax. In the play of Sophocles the Salaminian sailors imagine the passionate grief with which she will hear the evil tidings of her son; and Ajax vividly expresses the same foreboding.   Itis very possible (I think) that these passages were suggested by the prominent place which the laments of Eriboea and her handmaids held in the <title>Salaminiae</title><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Both these passages in the <title>Ajax</title> have a noteworthy emphasis.

(2) In vv. 850 f., Ajax, after briefly mentioning both his parents, goes on to speak of the manner in which his mother's sorrow will be manifested. The <quote lang="greek">Αἰάντεια</quote> of Aeschylus was probably one of his earlier trilogies—written, perhaps, while the new lustre shed on Ajax by the victory at Salamis was still fresh. In that case, the lyric element in the <quote lang="greek">Σαλαμίνιαι</quote> may have been very large, giving ample scope for <quote lang="greek">κομμοί</quote> between Eriboea and the Chorus.</note>. ‘The island of Ajax,’ as  Aeschylus calls Salamis, had a cult of the hero, including an annual festival (<quote lang="greek">Αἰάντεια</quote>); and an impressive conclusion would be given to the trilogy by Telamon decreeing honours to the memory of his son.

<span class="line-ref">Line 8</span><p>The award of the arms was not dramatised by Sophocles. <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles.</note> In his <title>Ajax</title> he assumes, like Pindar, that the award was decided by the Greek chiefs. For the rest, the outline of his plot is taken from the <title>Little Iliad.</title></p>
<p>The scene is laid before the tent of Ajax, at the eastern end <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play. I. Prologue: 1—133.</note> of the Greek camp, on the northern coast of the Troad. The time is early morning. Odysseus is scanning foot-prints on the ground,—walking to and fro as he does so, in perplexity. The goddess Athena (who is invisible, probably, to him, though seen by the spectators) speaks to him, and tells him that she can resolve his doubts. Ajax, whom he seeks, is within yonder tent. And Ajax has really done the outrage of which he is suspected: it is he who, in the past night, butchered the oxen and sheep of the Greeks, along with the men in charge of them. His plan had been to murder the Greek chiefs, beginning with the Atreidae; but, just as he had reached their tents, Athena struck him with frenzy, and turned his rage aside upon the cattle. At this moment he is tormenting some of the animals in his tent, fancying that they are the Greek princes. And she will show him to Odysseus. She then calls Ajax to come forth. Odysseus is alarmed at the prospect of being confronted with this raging madman: but the goddess reassures him; the maniac shall not see him.</p>
<p>Then Ajax comes out, with a blood-stained scourge in his hand, and boasts, with wild laughter, of his triumphs. He has killed the Atreidae, and now he is going to flog Odysseus to death. When he returns to his task, Athena reads the moral to her favourite. Let him beware of sinning, through pride, against the gods, as Ajax has done. ‘A day can humble all human things, and a day can lift them up; but the wise of heart are loved of the gods, and the evil are abhorred.’ Athena then disappears; and Odysseus departs.</p>
<p>The Chorus of Salaminians, followers of Ajax,—at once <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 134—200.</note> sailors and warriors,—now enter. They have heard the rumour  that Ajax is the author of the onslaught on the cattle, and are keenly disquieted. If the deed has really been his, he must have been driven to it by some angry deity who demented him. But they rather believe that it is a slander, prompted by the jealousy of the Greek chiefs. He has been too long secluded; let him arise, and clear his good name, which is theirs also.</p>
<p>At this moment <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 201—595. (First Kommos: 201—262.)</note> Tecmessa comes to them from the tent. She tells them that Ajax has gone mad, and has been slaughtering cattle in the tent. Thus they learn that the worst is true. In the lyric dialogue (kommos) which follows, they learn further that the frenzy of Ajax is past; he is sane again, but is plunged in the deepest despondency. She has just finished a detailed account of what happened in the night—how her lord sallied forth, how he returned, and how, while tormenting his victims, he conversed with ‘some phantom’ at the tent-door—when Ajax himself is heard calling from within. She opens the door of the tent (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the interior is disclosed by the eccyclema), and Ajax is seen sitting amidst the slaughtered cattle.</p>
<p>He cries <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Second Kommos: 348—429.)</note> to his trusty friends to slay him; he is disgraced, and has become a mockery to his foes: this shame has blotted out his past deeds. In vain the Chorus and Tecmessa try to comfort him. Each successive utterance makes it clearer that he can think of only one refuge. When at last he has said this plainly—reviewing the whole situation in which he finds himself, and reasoning out the conclusion that nothing remains for him but to die—Tecmessa makes her appeal. Let him think what his death will mean for her and for his child. His only reply is to command that the boy shall be brought to him. This is done; and the touching words which he then speaks (incidentally showing his affection for Tecmessa) are words of farewell. He charges the Chorus with his last injunctions for Teucer, who is to see that his armour is buried with him,—saving only the shield which his son Eurysaces (who takes his name from it) is to keep. And Teucer shall take Eurysaces home to Telamon and Eriboea in Salamis.—He then sternly commands Tecmessa to retire, with the child. She addresses him with despairing entreaties; but he roughly silences her, and withdraws into the tent.</p>
<p>The Chorus, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon: 596—645.</note> whose thoughts turn wistfully to Salamis, lament how their hard lot at Troy is now aggravated by this new and  dread affliction of their lord. They deplore his cruel fate, and imagine the grief of his aged parents. His plight is indeed such that death might well seem a lesser evil.</p>
<p>Ajax re-enters, with a sword in his hand. He had lately <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 646—692.</note> parted from his friends with an open and stern expression of his resolve to die. But now his first words announce at least a change of mood. Time can alter all things; and he has been softened. He is going ‘to purge his stains,’ and ‘to bury’ his sword. He wishes ‘to avoid’ the anger of Athena; and ‘henceforth’ he will know how to yield to the gods—and to revere the Atreidae. Perhaps they will soon hear that all is well with him.</p>
<p>A discussion of this speech will be found below (§ 12). Its <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Hyporcheme (serving as second stasimon): 693—718.</note> effect is to throw the Chorus into a transport of joy, to which they give vent in song, accompanied by lively dance. So Ajax has been reconciled to the gods, and has forgiven the Atreidae! The trouble is overpast!</p>
<p>A Messenger enters from the Greek camp. Teucer has just <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 719—865.</note> returned from a foray in the Mysian uplands. On his arrival, the infuriated Greeks had thronged around him, denouncing him as ‘the kinsman of the maniac,’ and threatening to stone him. Meanwhile the Greek chiefs had met in council before Agamemnon's tent. The seer Calchas, drawing apart from their circle, had given a private and friendly warning to Teucer. Ajax, he said, had incurred the anger of Athena, by proud words formerly spoken. But her anger will pursue him <emph>for this day only.</emph> If, during this day, he can be kept within the tent, his life may be saved.</p>
<p>On learning that Ajax has just gone out, the Messenger is filled with dismay, which the Chorus share. They call forth Tecmessa. On hearing what Calchas has said, she implores the Chorus at once to aid her in seeking Ajax. The Chorus now leave the orchestra, in two divisions. One division goes out on the left of the spectators, to search the coast eastward from the camp: the other goes out on the right, to search westwards. Tecmessa also goes forth, and the Messenger departs.</p>
<p>A change of scene now takes place—from the ground in front of the tent, to a lonely spot on the sea-shore, fringed with  underwood. (The change of scene in the <title>Eumenides</title>, from Delphi to Athens, is the only other certain instance in Greek Tragedy.)</p>
<p>Ajax is seen standing near the sword which he has fixed by its hilt in the ground. He invokes Zeus—to save his corpse from dishonour, by apprising Teucer: Hermes—to give him swift convoy to the nether world: the Furies—to avenge him on the Greeks: Helios—to tell the news in his island-home: Thanatos—to release him. Then he bids farewell to Salamis, to Athens, to the springs, rivers, and plains of Troy: and falls upon his sword.</p>
<p>The Chorus <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Epiparodos: 866—878. Third Kommos: 879—973.</note> re-enter the orchestra in two bands (as they left it), from opposite sides. They do not see the body of Ajax, which is screened by the underwood amid which it fell. While deploring the failure of their search, they hear a sharp cry of anguish from the copse near them. It is Tecmessa, who has found what they sought. She will not suffer them to see what she has seen, but covers the body with a robe.</p>
<p>Amid the laments <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode: 974— 1184.</note> which follow, Teucer hastens in: Zeus had heard the prayer of Ajax; ‘a swift rumour, as from a god,’ had come to the brother. His first thought is for the child that Ajax had bequeathed to his care; and on learning that Eurysaces has been left at the tent, he sends Tecmessa to fetch him. He then unshrouds the corpse; his bitter grief has free course; and as he withdraws the sword from the body which it has transfixed, he remembers that it was Hector's fatal gift.</p>
<p>Menelaüs now enters, and roughly tells Teucer that the body of Ajax is to remain where it lies, unburied. Ajax was a worse than Trojan foe; he had plotted the murder of his comrades, who were saved only by divine interposition. Reverence for authority shall be upheld: Ajax defied the Atreidae while he lived, but they will dispose of him in death. Teucer replies to the second part of the indictment—the charge of insubordination. Ajax was an independent ally, not a vassal of the Atreidae. In the stormy altercation which follows, Menelaüs has the worst of it, and departs, with a hint that he can bring force to bear.</p>
<p>He has just gone, when Tecmessa comes, with the child  Eurysaces, for whom Teucer had sent her to the tent. (Henceforth she is a mute person.) The child is now made to kneel, in the posture of a suppliant, by his father's body, holding in his hand locks of hair (his own, Tecmessa's, and Teucer's), as offerings to the dead. Teucer fears that Menelaüs may seek to separate the kinsfolk from the body of Ajax by force: he therefore places the body under this religious safeguard of a formal ‘supplication,’ and invokes a solemn curse on any one who may attempt to remove the suppliant by violence. He then goes out, to choose a place for the grave of Ajax.</p>
<p>The Chorus bewail their hardships at Troy. Ajax was once <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon: 1185— 1222.</note> their comfort, and they have lost him. Would that they could pass Sunium, and greet sacred Athens!</p>
<p>Teucer re-enters hurriedly, having noticed the approach of <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Exodos: 1223— 1420.</note> Agamemnon, who appears directly afterwards. Agamemnon reproves the presumption of Teucer (‘the captive woman's son’). What, after all, was this Ajax? ‘Whither went he, or where stood he, where I was not?’ Ajax lost the arms: that is no reason why Teucer should attack the judges. ‘Sober thyself, I say;—recall thy birth;—bring hither someone else,—a freeborn man,—who shall plead thy cause for thee before us.’ Teucer makes a scathing reply. He reminds the king who it was that saved the ships from Trojan fire and sword,—who it was that met Hector in single combat. ‘Were these deeds not his, who, thou sayest, nowhere set foot where thou wast not?’ As to the taunt that he, Teucer, is disqualified by birth for being the champion of Ajax—can the son of Atreus and Aëropè say that to the son of Telamon and Hesionè? With Tecmessa and Eurysaces, he is ready to die in this cause.</p>
<p>At this point—when nothing seems to remain but that the Atreidae should enforce their will—Odysseus enters. He intercedes with Agamemnon, who is ready to hear ‘his best friend.’ ‘Ajax,’ he says, ‘was my bitterest foe, after I won the arms’: but ‘in all our Greek host which came to Troy, I have seen none who was his peer, save Achilles.’ Agamemnon argues, wavers, and finally says that, though <emph>he</emph> will always detest Ajax, Odysseus may do as he pleases.</p>
<p>The king having gone, Odysseus proffers friendship to Teucer,  and expresses a wish to take part in the obsequies. Teucer warmly thanks him,—contrasting his noble conduct with that of the Atreidae. He fears to accept the co-operation of Odysseus in the actual rites, lest that should displease the dead; but will welcome his presence as a spectator, and his help in conciliating the army. Odysseus assents, and withdraws.</p>
<p>Various tasks in relation to the funeral are now assigned to the Chorus by Teucer. He raises the body of the hero, directing the child to lay his hand upon it, that he too may have a part in the office. Then Ajax is carried forth, followed by his wife and his son, with Teucer and the Salaminian warriors, to be laid by the Hellespont in his grave at Cape Rhoeteum, the grave which was to be ‘ever memorable among men<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The words of the Chorus in vv. 1166 f., <quote lang="greek">βροτοῖς τὸν ἀείμνηστον | τάφον</quote>.</note>.’

<span class="line-ref">Line 9</span><p>The first question <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Dramatic unity of the play.</note> which this play suggests is one which must be considered before any criticism of detail can be profitably attempted—before, indeed, even the character of the hero himself, as drawn by Sophocles, can be properly appreciated. How did the poet conceive the subject of his drama as a whole? What was the nature of the unity which he intended his work to possess? Ajax dies at verse 865: more than a third of the play follows his death, and is concerned with the question as to whether he is, or is not, to be buried. A reader is apt to feel that, with the suicide of Ajax, the principal interest has disappeared. Modern criticism has suggested various apologies for the latter part of the play; the supreme importance which the ancient Greeks attached to funeral rites, as affecting the condition of the departed spirit; the advantage incidental to the controversy between Teucer and the Atreidae, that the merits of Ajax are triumphantly asserted; the edifying victory of prudence and magnanimity in the person of Odysseus. All such considerations, however, tend only to show, first, that this part of the play would have been interesting, on general grounds, to a Greek audience; and secondly, that it is not irrelevant to the subject of the earlier portion. But more than this is required, if the sequel to the hero's death is to be justified as a matter of dramatic art. It has to be explained how the action of the  play, from beginning to end, can be regarded as an organic whole. The idea which pervades it, giving it unity and coherence, must be such that the death of Ajax can be viewed, not as a catastrophe after which everything else becomes tame, but rather as a tragic event necessarily leading to the events which follow it, so that the true climax is reached only in that decision which rescues the corpse of Ajax from dishonour. We must endeavour to trace this idea; or, in other words, to find the point of view from which Sophocles may be supposed to have regarded his own work.

<span class="line-ref">Line 10</span><p>The first circumstance which demands notice is the fact <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The veto on the burial.</note> that Athena visited Ajax with madness only at the moment when he already stood, in the darkness of night, before the tents of the Atreidae, prepared to murder them in their sleep. He was still sane when he plotted that bloody vengeance against them and the other chiefs. When, after his madness, he regains his sanity, he bitterly laments, at first, that his plan had been foiled. The award of the arms had been unjust. But, none the less, Ajax had merited, by his murderous design, the resentment of the Atreidae and of the Greek army. The public feeling in the camp, on the morning after the outrage, would have fully sustained Agamemnon in visiting him with the extreme penalty which the usage of that age sanctioned in regard to public enemies—the refusal of sepulture. The poet has taken care to let us know this—<emph>before</emph> the death of Ajax—by the mouth of the messenger who brings the warning of Calchas to Teucer. The Greeks, crowding around Teucer, threaten to stone him, guiltless as he is, merely because he is ‘the kinsman of the maniac who had plotted against the army<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Vv. 726 ff.</note>.’ Ajax himself, in his last speech, forebodes that burial will be refused to him; his only prayer to Zeus is that his body may not be cast to the dogs and birds. The spectators are thus clearly forewarned that, after the fall of Ajax, anger must inevitably break forth against him, menacing him with a calamity more dreadful than death. Hence the intervention of the Atreidae, when it occurs, appears as a necessary consequence of what has preceded. It is the  bursting of a storm of which we have seen menacing signs, and even heard the first distant mutterings.

For Ajax, at the beginning of the play, has been shown in the deepest humiliation,—a maniac whom Athena exhibits, with his fatuous boasting and his frantic laughter, for the admonition of his successful rival. Yet this Ajax is the same to whom the Athenian spectators, like their fathers before them, had been taught to pay divine honours<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The Athenian cult of Ajax still existed in the time of Pausanias, who says (1. 35. 3): —<quote lang="greek">διαμένουσι δὲ καὶ ἐς τόδε τῷ Αἴαντι παρὰ Ἀθηναίοις τιμαί, αὐτῷ τε καὶ Εὐρυσάκει· καὶ γὰρ Εὐρυσάκους βωμός ἐστιν ἐν Ἀθήναις</quote>.

In following the progress of the play, it would be impossible for Athenians to think of him merely as a great warrior, whose honour had been restored by his resolve to die. They would necessarily think of him also as a sacred ‘hero,’ in the religious sense of that word. The restoration of his honour would not be complete, in their view, unless, at the end, he appeared as a fitting recipient of the worship which they paid to him. But, for such an end, it was indispensable that he should receive funeral rites. The cult of a ‘hero’ meant the worship of the spirit of a dead man, who in life had been pre-eminent for great qualities. The first condition of such worship was that the departed spirit should have been duly admitted to the realm of the nether gods by the rendering of funeral rites. The central point in the cult of a ‘hero’ was his tomb. The offerings at the hero's tomb (or at a ‘herôon’ which represented it) corresponded, in that cult, with the sacrifices offered to the gods at their altars<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">ἐναγίζειν</quote> is the ordinary term for making offerings <emph>at a grave</emph> to the departed spirit (Isae. or. 6 § 51 <quote lang="greek">ἐπὶ τὰ μνήματα ἰέναι χεόμενον καὶ ἐναγιοῦντα</quote>), and is regularly used with reference to the cult of a hero, as opposed to <quote lang="greek">θύειν</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 2. 44" valid="yes"> Her. 2. 44</bibl><quote lang="greek">τῷ μὲν ὡς ἀθανάτῳ...θύουσι, τῷ δὲ ἑτέρῳ ὡς ἥρωι ἐναγίζουσι</quote>.

The prehistoric tumuli on the shore of the Hellespont, associated with the names of Achilles, Patroclus, and Ajax, were regarded as the monuments which attested that those heroes had received  due sepulture, and were, in fact, the primary shrines of their respective cults—honoured, as such, in every age of Greek antiquity<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Preller, <title>Gr. Myth.</title> II. p. 6, as to the bearing of such mounds, or of supposed ‘relics,’ on the earlier cult of heroes.</note>. So when an Athenian audience heard the Atreidae insisting that the corpse of Ajax should be ‘food for the birds by the sea,’ and Teucer insisting that it should be duly buried the interest of the dispute for them did not depend merely on the importance of burial as a condition of peace for <emph>any</emph> departed spirit. The question involved much more than that,—viz., the whole claim of Ajax to the sanctity of a ‘hero,’—one with which so many traditions of Athens were bound up. The Athenian feeling would be analogous to that of a medieval audience witnessing a drama which concerned the life of a canonized saint, in which the doubtful issue was whether the powers of evil would succeed in making him commit some sin which would doom his soul beyond the hope of pardon. Such an audience would have followed, with a like depth of interest, the process by which the wiles of the tempter were defeated at the moment when they seemed about to triumph, and the man emerged at the end, notwithstanding weaknesses and lapses, as a worthy object of religious veneration.</p>
<p>These, then, are the grounds on which the dramatic unity of the <title>Ajax</title> rests. First, the veto upon the burial of Ajax is an inevitable consequence of his action, and one for which the spectator has been prepared; so that the latter part of the play is not an arbitrary addition to the former, but a natural, indeed a necessary, development of it. Secondly, this veto raises an issue still more momentous, for Athenians, than the question whether Ajax is to live or die; viz., the issue whether he is, or is not, to attain the sanctity of a hero. Hence the true climax of the play is not his death, but the decision that he shall be buried.

<span class="line-ref">Line 12</span><p>Consecration as a hero <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The successive moods of Ajax.</note> is the goal to which the poet brings Ajax; and this is to be remembered in tracing the mental phases through which he passes. On first recovering his sanity, he gives utterance to bitter lamentation, deploring the triumph of his foes and his own disgrace, and praying for death. Then the  resolve to die takes definite shape in his mind: he forms it with full deliberation, after a review of the possible alternatives. He takes farewell of his child, with a stern tenderness both for him and for Tecmessa. He silences her appeals, curtly and roughly —but the very roughness indicates that a struggle is going on within him. Then he retires into the solitude of his tent. After an interval, during which the Chorus chant an ode, he comes forth again, sword in hand, and delivers that speech, which, more <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">His speech in vv. 646 —692.</note> than any other passage in the play, has divided the opinions of critics. A correct appreciation of it is, indeed, of the first importance. On the meaning attached to parts of it must depend our conception of the mood in which Sophocles meant Ajax to quit life; and this, in turn, must affect the interpretation of the play as a whole.</p>
<p>He begins thus:—</p>
<p>All things the long and countless years first draw from darkness, then bury from light; and there is nothing for which man may not look; the dread oath is vanquished, and the stubborn will. For even I, erst so wondrous firm,—yea, as iron hardened in the dipping,—felt the keen edge of my temper softened by yon woman's words; and I feel the pity of leaving her a widow with my foes, and the boy an orphan.</p>
<p>It was once the prevalent view that this utterance, like all others in the speech, must be regarded as deliberately designed by Ajax to mislead his hearers, Tecmessa and the Chorus. While he speaks these words, he is still resolved to die: that is certain. It was inferred that he must be grimly ironical when he speaks of having been ‘softened,’ or of ‘feeling pity’ at leaving his wife and child. Welcker<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In his excellent essay on the <title>Ajax</title> in the <title>Rhein. Museum</title> for 1829, pt. 3, pp. 43—92, 229—264 (reprinted in his <title>Kleine Schriften</title>).</note> was the first to maintain— what is unquestionably true—that a change of mood has really taken place in Ajax. He <emph>has</emph> been touched by Tecmessa's pleading; he <emph>does</emph> feel pity. Nor is it necessary to suppose that this change has been abrupt—taking place during his brief seclusion in the tent. Ajax is rugged, imperious and resolute, but not hard of heart: his love for his wife and his child have been hinted already. His words now suggest, indeed, that his new pity will <emph>forbid</emph> him to die. So far—and so far only—they are delusive.</p>
<p>He continues:—</p>
<p>But I will go to the bathing-place and the meadows by the shore, that in purging of my stains I may flee the heavy anger of the goddess. Then I will seek out some untrodden spot, and bury this sword, hatefullest of weapons, digging in the earth where none shall see; no, let Night and Hades keep it underground! For since my hand took this gift from Hector, my worst foe, to this hour I have had no good from the Greeks. Yes, men's proverb is true: <title>The gifts of enemies are no gifts</title>, <emph>and bring no good.</emph></p>
<p>The words fit his real design. He is indeed going to ‘purge his stains’—by death. He will fix his sword in the earth, and ‘bury’ it—in his body; Night shall ‘keep it underground’—in his grave. But is it not manifest that, after his previous reference to the change in his mood, his hearers would necessarily understand these words in their literal sense—as meaning that he would wash off with sea-water the stains left on him by the slaughter of the cattle,—would seek to propitiate Athena,—and would bury his ill-omened sword in the ground, where it could do no more mischief? This is so evident that it would seem hardly needful to state it, were it not that some eminent critics had maintained a different view. Welcker<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Op. cit.</title> p. 229. Welcker compares the language of Ajax here to that of the prayer which Clytaemnestra utters in Electra's presence—a <quote lang="greek">κεκρυμμένη βάξις</quote>, as she herself terms it ( <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 638" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 638</bibl>). That is, the terms in which Ajax expresses his purpose are, indeed, only allusive; but there is nothing in them which it is <emph>impossible</emph> for the hearers to understand; no clue is wanting which they do not possess,—as Aegisthus, for instance, does <emph>not</emph> possess the clue to Electra's irony ( <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 1448" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 1448</bibl> ff.). The answer to Welcker's view may, I think, be given in Aristotle's phrase ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Rh. 1.2" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title> 1. 2.</bibl>§ 13), <quote lang="greek">ὁ γὰρ κριτὴς ὑπόκειται εἶναι ἁπλοῦς</quote>. A sufficiently acute hearer would perhaps have suspected the truth; but the Chorus and Tecmessa are supposed to be simple persons.</note>, followed by Thudichum<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In his German Translation of Sophocles, with notes: vol. II. pp. 150 f. (1838). He is in general agreement with Welcker; but allows that, if Ajax had no intention to deceive, it is at least remarkable that his purpose is described throughout only in ‘figurative’ language; and that a misapprehension of it would be easy.</note>, and (with some qualifications) by Thirlwall<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In his essay ‘On the Irony of Sophocles,’ where Welcker's view of this speech is examined, and, on the whole, approved (<title>Phil. Museum</title>, vol. I. pp. 514 ff.: 1833). Thirlwall is the only writer (so far as I know) who has really grappled with the objections to Welcker's view that the words <quote lang="greek">κρύψω τόδ’ ἔγχος τοὐμόν</quote>, etc., might be spoken by Ajax <emph>without</emph> intention to deceive. He grants that this passage ‘at first sight’ suggests ‘a deliberate intention to mislead.’ Nay, he admits that any other view is ‘scarcely possible, if it had been only the <emph>fatality</emph> of the weapon that he had in his thoughts.’ [The italics are mine.] ‘But,’ Thirlwall proceeds, ‘perhaps it may be more easily conceived, if we suppose him to have reflected on it rather as having been once <emph>the object of his pride</emph>, a tribute of respect to his valour from a respected enemy, and afterward the instrument of his shame. He was now about to expiate his pride, and to wipe off his shame: in both respects he might be said to “hide” his sword in the most emphatic sense, when he sheathed it in his own body.’—Thirlwall's argument (as I understand it) comes to this. It is just conceivable that, in saying <quote lang="greek">κρύψω τόδ’ ἔγχος</quote>, etc., Ajax did <emph>not</emph> intend to deceive, if we suppose that the thought in his mind was:—‘I will put that sword, <emph>once my glory and my joy</emph>, out of sight for ever’ [and not: ‘I will bury that sword, which has <emph>brought me only woe</emph>’]: because the words, so viewed, would suggest an antithesis between <emph>glorious life</emph>—and something else. But, if Ajax had been thus thinking of his sword, as ‘once the object of his pride,’ would he have said merely, <quote lang="greek">κρύψω τόδ’ ἔγχος τοὐμόν, ἔχθιστον βελῶν</quote>? Does not this (with the two verses which follow) clearly show that it was ‘only the fatality of the weapon that he had in his thoughts’?</note>, thinks that Ajax  has no intention to mislead his hearers: he expresses his real purpose, in veiled language, no doubt, but it is their fault that they do not understand him. This view we may unhesitatingly reject. Ajax deliberately deceives his hearers. The art by which he does so, without saying anything that is not verbally true, is so contrived as to give the spectators the kind of pleasure which is felt in guessing a riddle. It would be a mistake to suppose that ancient Greeks would have seen anything unworthy or unheroic in the use of such deception. He is resolved to die, and to die in solitude. He also feels a real tenderness for those whom he is leaving. He cannot part from them in silence; nor, again, can he bring himself to speak openly, and to part from them—as would then be necessary—by force. He therefore veils his farewell so that it is such only to his own mind, not to their apprehension. Greeks would think of this as of a stratagem in war; and the hero would not suffer in their eyes, since the end in view is (as they would think) heroic. Ajax next says:—</p>
<p>Therefore henceforth I shall know how to yield to the gods, and learn to revere the Atreidae. They are rulers, so we must submit. How else? Dread things and things most potent bow to office; thus it is that snowstrewn winter gives place to fruitful summer; and thus night's weary round makes room for day with her white steeds to kindle light; and the breath of dreadful winds can allow the groaning sea to slumber; and, like the rest, almighty Sleep looses whom he has bound, nor holds with a perpetual grasp.</p>
<p>And we—must we not learn discretion? I, at least, will learn it; for I am newly aware that our enemy is to be hated but as one who will hereafter be a friend; and towards a friend I would wish but thus far to show aid and service, as knowing that he will not always abide. For to most men the haven of friendship is false.</p>
<p>Here it is of especial moment to determine how far he is saying what he really means, and how far he is ironical. Is he ironical, to begin with, in saying that he will ‘yield to the gods’? When Tecmessa appealed to him in their name, he cried out, in the sharp anguish of the moment, that he owed them no further service (v. 589 f.)—as he had said before that he was ‘plainly hateful’ to them (v. 457). But, since then, he has been alone for a time with his own thoughts, and (as we have seen) his mood has been changed by pity for those whom he is leaving. If his profession of ‘yielding to the gods’ were ironical, his real meaning must be that he defies them: he would be a Capaneus, a Mezentius<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As is well observed by Welcker (p. 235), and by Thirlwall (p. 519).</note>. But the sense in which he ‘yields’ to the gods is not merely that he takes a step to which they have driven him, and retires from life: to ‘yield,’ in that sense, would be merely to accept the inevitable. He ‘yields’ to the gods in the further sense that he has come to see the folly of the pride in which he formerly despised their help. His words are sad, and are tinged with bitterness; still, they are the proof that he has been chastened by the judgment of Athena, and has learned not ‘to think thoughts too high for man.’ But what is to be said of his other promise,—‘to revere the Atreidae’? In his last soliloquy he invokes the Furies to punish them for his wrongs. We might be inclined to say that here, at least, he speaks with bitter irony. And that there is some irony in the form of the phrase, need not be doubted. But then submission to the gods and reverence for the Atreidae are alike enforced by him in the sublime illustration which he draws from the elemental powers of nature. To employ imagery so solemn and so beautiful for the purpose of pointing mere mockery would be incongruous and repulsive. Undoubtedly Sophocles conceived Ajax as really meaning that he would thenceforth ‘revere the Atreidae’—in this sense:—that he had come to recognise his offence against social order in  failing to reverence their station, and to accept the authoritative award of the arms without attempting to exact vengeance. Such a perception would be in no way inconsistent with continued resentment against the Atreidae personally, as unjust men, or with an invocation of divine avengers to smite them. Thus the conversion which Ajax announces in himself is a real one: the element of deception is in his mode of stating it; since, when he says that ‘henceforth<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Verse 666, <quote lang="greek">τὸ λοιπόν</quote>. For Ajax himself this signifies, ‘in what of life remains to me.’ Thirlwall observes (<foreign lang="la">op. cit.</foreign> p. 519): ‘These professions would certainly be mere dissimulation if they referred to anything but the approaching termination of his career, whereas they seem to imply a prospect of its continuance. Yet, if Ajax contemplated his death as a satisfaction both to divine and human justice, his manner of describing the lesson which he had learnt and would thenceforth practise, is not unnatural, but strongly emphatic.’ The last sentence is true; but not (I venture to think) the dilemma stated in the first. Ajax means his hearers to understand that he has resolved to go on living. Yet his utterance is not ‘<emph>mere</emph> dissimulation’; for he is really prepared to ‘yield to the gods,’ and (in his own sense) to ‘revere the Atreidae.’</note>’ he will practise these precepts, he implies, and clearly intends his hearers to understand, that he will continue to live.</p>
<p>The speech ends thus:—</p>
<p>But concerning these things it will be well.—Woman, go thou within, and pray to the gods that in all fulness the desires of my heart may be fulfilled. And ye, my friends,—honour ye these my wishes even as she doth; and bid Teucer, when he come, have care for me, and good-will towards you withal. For I will go whither I must pass; but do ye what I bid; and ere long, perchance, though now I suffer, ye will hear that I have found peace.</p>
<p>Welcker argues that Ajax cannot have intended to mislead his friends, because this last passage plainly points to death: indeed, he thinks, the poet might even be reproached with some disregard of probability in allowing the Chorus to be deceived by it. It is true that the disguise is thinnest here. But the meaning which hearers would attach to the words would necessarily depend on what had gone before. When the belief that Ajax meant to live had been fixed in their minds by the earlier part of the speech, nothing in this last part could undeceive them.</p>
<p>The foregoing analysis will have shown that I cannot entirely agree with any interpretation of this speech, as a whole, which has hitherto been given. The difficulties which have been felt in it have largely arisen (as it appears to me) from an assumption, express or tacit, that every part of the speech must bear a similar relation to the real thoughts of Ajax. It has been supposed that everywhere he is practising dissimulation<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">For instance, Döderlein, in his essay on the <title>Ajax</title>, sums up his estimate of the speech in the words, ‘<foreign lang="la">tota simulatio est</foreign>’ (<title>Abhandl. der Philosophisch-Philolog. Classe der k. Bayer. Akad.</title>, vol. II. p. 120, 1837). Schlegel's view is similar (<title>Dramatic Lit.</title>, p. 107, Eng. tr.). This was, indeed, the traditional conception.</note>; or else that everywhere he is saying what he really means, darkly, indeed, yet without the intention of deceiving<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Thus Thirlwall says (<foreign lang="la">op. cit.</foreign> p. 519): ‘If the aim of Ajax is to deceive his friends, admitting the contrivance to be worthy of his character, and consistent with his previous conduct, he cannot reasonably be supposed more in earnest in one part of the speech than another.’</note>. The fact seems to be rather that three distinct threads are subtly interwoven in the texture of the speech; viz., direct expression of his real mind; irony in a form which does not necessarily imply the intention to mislead; and artifice of language so elaborate as necessarily to imply such an intention, at any rate when addressed to simple hearers. While the change of purpose is feigned, the change of mood is real. At his first return to sanity, he had thought of death only as a refuge from disgrace and a recovery of honour. He has now come to view it also as an atonement due to Athena. He recognises the sin of his former over-weening self-confidence. In this sense he dies reconciled to the gods. And that reconciliation has come through the human affections. He had listened to Tecmessa, and parted from his son, without being turned from his resolve, but not without being profoundly moved. The inward workings of pity recalled him to a human standard of feeling, and so revived his sense of human weakness, and of the submission which mortals owe to gods. It was as natural for an ancient Greek to derive fear of the gods from a painful breaking of human ties as it is for Christians to deduce the love of man from the love of God.

<span class="line-ref">Line 13</span><p>In the final soliloquy of Ajax, his change of mood is <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">His imprecation upon the Greeks.</note> obscured by another sentiment which moderns might think inconsistent with it,—viz., his fierce vindictiveness towards those who had given the award of the arms against him (vv. 835 ff.):—</p>
<p>And I call for help to the maidens who live for ever, and ever look on all the woes of men, the dread, far-striding Furies; let them mark how my miserable life is blasted by the Atreidae. And may they overtake those evil men with doom most evil and with utter blight !...Come, ye swift and vengeful Furies, glut your wrath on all the host, and spare not!</p>
<p>To the ancients, however, such utterances would have seemed perfectly compatible with the altered mood of Ajax. He has come to see that he erred in his over-weening selfreliance; he ‘yields to the gods,’ and acknowledges that the office of human rulers claims respect: but he also feels implacable resentment for a wrong. ‘Benefit thy friends and hurt thy foes,’ was the received Greek maxim. Now and again a higher ethical teaching declares that the just man will not knowingly injure any one<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><foreign lang="la">E.g.</foreign> <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Rep. 335d" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Rep.</title> 1. p. 335 D</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἄρα τοῦ δικαίου βλάπτειν ἔργον...οὔτε φίλον οὔτ’ ἄλλον οὐδένα</quote>: in opposition to the common maxim (<foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> A), <quote lang="greek">δίκαιον εἶναι τὸν μὲν φίλον εὖ ποιεῖν, τὸν δὲ ἐχθρὸν κακῶς</quote>.</note>. But a man might be morally good, in the ordinary Greek view, and also pious (<quote lang="greek">εὐσεβής</quote>), without accepting that doctrine: Solon, who was esteemed both, prays that he may be ‘sweet to his friends and bitter to his foes<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Frag. 13. 5 (Bergk), <quote lang="greek">εἶναι δὲ γλυκὺν ὧδε φίλοις, ἐχθροῖσι δὲ πικρόν</quote>.</note>’; Pindar, a pre-eminently religious poet, who speaks as with the voice of Delphi, expresses a like sentiment<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Pyth.</title> 2. 83 <quote lang="greek">φίλον εἴη φιλεῖν· | ποτὶ δ’ ἐχθρὸν ἅτ’ ἐχθρὸς ἐὼν λύκοιο δίκαν ὑποθεύσομαι</quote>.</note>. A striking parallel to the case of Ajax here is presented by that of Oedipus at Colonus. Oedipus has found rest and peace at the shrine of the Eumenides; he has been reconciled with the gods; he is already invested with a kind of sanctity; he is on his way— like Ajax—to consecration as a hero: and it is in these circumstances that he utters the appalling imprecations on his sons. Still, in one respect the vindictiveness of Ajax must appear monstrous; he invokes destruction, not only on the chiefs, but  on ‘all the host.’ It can hardly be said that the army at large were involved in the guilt of the award<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">This is the apology suggested by Welcker (<title>Rhein. Mus.</title> for 1829, III. p. 246), and by Thirlwall (<title>Phil. Mus.</title> I. p. 521: ‘the army had sanctioned and shared the iniquity of its chiefs’). I cannot think that it is satisfactory.</note>; they had nothing to do with it, and could not prevent or reverse it. A simpler account of the matter seems to be that the punishment of the army is conceived as a further penalty on the chiefs. This would be thoroughly Homeric. Apollo avenges his priest on Agamemnon by plaguing the whole army, just as he might have punished a wicked shepherd by a murrain.

<span class="line-ref">Line 14</span><p>Ajax passes, then, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The divine judgment. Athena.</note> reconciled to the gods; and so in a manner suited to that event which is the real end of the play, his accession to the order of worshipped heroes. We may now briefly consider the nature of the divine discipline which he undergoes. The words of the seer Calchas, reported by the Messenger<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Verses 756—779.</note>, must be taken as interpreting the poet's conception of it. Ajax had angered Athena by certain proud words, saying that <emph>he</emph> did not need divine aid in battle. These were casual boasts, in seasons of elation—like that vaunt of Agamemnon, on hitting a stag, which angered Artemis<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See n. on <title>Electra</title> v. 569.</note>. Ajax was not a bad or impious man; but he showed a pride, too great for a mortal, which required chastisement. Athena chose the moment when a wound to this pride had goaded him into plotting the murder of the chiefs. She struck him with the madness in which he slew the cattle. When the frenzy was past, there settled over him a profound despondency which was also sent by her, being the sequel of her visitation. If (said Calchas) he could only be kept in the tent for that day, all would be well; the anger of Athena would vex him <emph>for that day only.</emph> That is, the despair, which bent his thoughts on suicide, would depart from him on the morrow. He would see that honour did not require his death, since his frenzy had been the judgment of the goddess; cured of his arrogance, he might give new proofs of prudence and valour. But here destiny came in: the message of Calchas arrived too late.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, where Athena holds the dialogue with Ajax and displays his madness, her terrible irony might at first suggest that she is a malignant goddess, exulting in the wretchedness of her victim; but any such impression would be soon corrected by those words of calm majesty in which she points the moral for Odysseus. There is no trace of personal malignity in her attitude towards Ajax. She represents the divine power which judges human arrogance; she corrects it; but she has justly measured the offence, and sets a corresponding limit to her chastisement. It is fated that Ajax shall die; but the shadow of Athena's anger does not rest upon his grave, or trouble the worship which her own people render to him.

<span class="line-ref">Line 15</span><p>Odysseus, appearing only at the beginning and at the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Odysseus.</note> end of the play, is the human exponent of Athena's spirit. In the first scene he is engaged in a pursuit which the goddess declares to be characteristic of him,—the endeavour to track out Ajax, and to ascertain whether he is the author of the onslaught on the cattle. Athena is aiding him, and now, as ever, he is ‘guided by her hand.’ After witnessing the frenzy of his foe, he at once proves himself her true disciple by the pity which he feels, and by his quickened sense of human nothingness. As Athena says to him, ‘The wise of heart are loved of the gods.’ At the close of the drama, when he intercedes with Agamemnon, he urges that the career of Ajax must be judged as a whole; that he was their greatest man after Achilles; and that the enmity against him must not be carried beyond death. Agamemnon yields to him: Teucer praises his magnanimity. Yet this magnanimity bears the mark of being Athena's gift; it springs from high intelligence as much as from chivalrous sentiment. Odysseus may, in his turn, be afflicted by a god; he, too, may come to need a grave; and therefore he sympathises with Ajax<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">V. 124 <quote lang="greek">οὐδὲν τὸ τούτου μᾶλλον ἢ τοὐμὸν σκοπῶν</quote>: v. 1365 <quote lang="greek">καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἐνθάδ’ ἵξομαι</quote>.</note>. This is ‘to think as befits a man,’—the wise moderation which the gods love, and which, though not disinterested, leads to generous action. When Odysseus shrinks from confronting the herculean maniac, this is not ‘cowardice’; if Athena calls it so<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">V. 75 <quote lang="greek">οὐ σῖγ’ ἀνέξει μηδὲ δειλίαν ἀρεῖ;</quote> M. Patin (<title>Sophocle</title>, p. 11) remarks that this passage has been much censured, as if it defamed Odysseus; whereas that very pursuit of Ajax, in which he is engaged, sufficiently attests his courage. That is true; but we must also allow, I think, that the alarm of Odysseus is so described that it might easily raise a smile (see, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, v. 88 <quote lang="greek">μένοιμ’ ἄν· ἤθελον δ’ ἂν ἐκτὸς ὢν τυχεῖν</quote>). There was a tendency in post-Homeric poetry to depict Odysseus, the representative of <quote lang="greek">φρόνησις</quote>, as subordinating valour to discretion; (see Introd. to the <title>Philoctetes</title> p. xvii, xxxi;) though in Sophocles this tendency is controlled by a delicate tact. Here, the dramatic motive for the trepidation of Odysseus is to bring into stronger relief all that is terrible in the condition of Ajax.</note>, it is  because he forgets her promise to protect him<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Vv. 68—70.</note>; what it really indicates is his habitual reasonableness and prudence. On the whole, the Odysseus of this play much resembles the hero of the <title>Odyssey</title> (who pays a generous tribute to the sullen Ajax in the shades<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 11.556" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 11. 556</bibl> f.</note>); a resemblance which is mainly due to the direct and ennobling guidance of Athena.

<span class="line-ref">Line 16</span><p>The part of Teucer <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Teucer.</note> has a singular pathos. He is altogether devoted to his brother Ajax, by whose side he so often fought, and is strenuously loyal to the trust reposed in him. When he arrives, his first thought is for the safety of Eurysaces. With Teucer alone it rests to defend the memory of Ajax, and to insist that he shall have burial. Firm in his good cause, he braves the threats and repels the taunts of the Atreidae. Yet he well knows the prospect that is before him. When he thinks of his return to Salamis, he can foresee the fury with which the aged Telamon will denounce him, the son of the slave-woman, as the base betrayer of his true-born brother. He will be cast off, and driven forth into exile<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Vv. 1006—1020. The reference here to the subject of the poet's <quote lang="greek">Τεῦκρος</quote> is like that in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> (1410 n.) to his <title>Antigone</title>, and that in the <title>Philoctetes</title> (1437 ff.) to his <quote lang="greek">Φιλοκτήτης ἐν Τροίᾳ</quote>.</note>.</p>
<p>The intervention of the Atreidae <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">His scenes with the Atreidae.</note> has already been considered in its general relation to the dominant idea of the play. Their scenes with Teucer now require consideration from a different point of view, viz., with regard to the poetical workmanship. One aim of the poet has evidently been to prolong the controversy sufficiently for a gradual tension of interest. This is especially manifest in the words of the Chorus after the exit of  Menelaüs,—‘A dread strife will be brought to the trial<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">V. 1163.</note>’; words which mark the <foreign lang="it">crescendo</foreign>, and prepare the way for Agamemnon. The whole process which leads up to the climax is skilfully managed. First, there is the scene between Teucer and Menelaüs. The king of Sparta has those traits of harshness and arrogance which Athenian audiences would expect in the part<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">It is to Menelaüs that the Andromachè of Euripides addresses her invective against Sparta ( <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Andr. 445" valid="yes"> <title>Andr.</title> 445</bibl> ff.).—Welcker (<title>Rhein. Mus.</title> for 1829, pt. iii. pp. 258 ff.) finds allusions in this part of the play to contemporary relations between Athens and Sparta (Menelaüs), and between Athens and Argos (Agamemnon): but I cannot think that the poet intended this.</note>, and is clearly intended to be more odious than his brother. Though he is not the Captain General,—as Teucer reminds him, —yet the insubordination of Ajax is the topic on which he chooses to dwell. Ajax, he complains, would never obey him; and then he enlarges (like Creon in the <title>Antigone</title>) on the public danger of unruliness. After his angry dialogue with Teucer, he departs, with a hint of appeal to force. Then comes that beautiful scene which affords a pause between the two parts of the controversy; the child Eurysaces is brought in by Tecmessa, and placed as a suppliant by the corpse of Ajax. In the choral ode which follows, it may be noticed that the closing prayer—to pass beneath Sunium, and ‘greet sacred Athens’—is peculiarly suggestive at this point, when Teucer has just encountered the Spartan, and is about to withstand the Argive. The second chapter of the contest then begins with the entrance of Agamemnon. He alone can finally decide whether burial shall or shall not be granted. Whereas Menelaüs had resented the want of deference in Ajax, Agamemnon takes a more vital point, and depreciates his services. This calls forth the fine vindication of Ajax by Teucer, in which the debate culminates. The short dialogue which ensues between Agamemnon and Odysseus shows the former in a comparatively favourable light, and illustrates his superiority to Menelaüs. If he is not gracious or generous, he at least indicates a wish to see his duty<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See on v. 1350, <quote lang="greek">τόν τοι τύραννον εὐσεβεῖν οὐ ῥᾴδιον</quote>. There is a somewhat similar utterance of Agamemnon in a fragment of the <title>Polyxena</title> (fr. 481 Nauck), where he is perplexed by conflicting demands upon him.</note>, and is capable of yielding to wise counsel. Thus the whole controversy concerning  the burial of Ajax has variety, dramatic life, and a gradually rising interest.</p>
<p>To those who further realise <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Modern criticism on this part of the play.</note> that the decision concerning the burial is the true climax of the drama, this part of the play will certainly not appear unworthy of its author. The disfavour which it has sometimes found with modern criticism may be ascribed partly to inadequate appreciation of its poetical art and dramatic significance, but more, perhaps, to the fact that a prolonged rhetorical debate has not the same attraction for modern readers which an ancient Athenian audience found in it. The example of Aeschylus in his <title>Award of the Arms</title>, where Ajax and Odysseus spoke in support of their respective claims, may have had some influence in leading Sophocles to compensate for the more restricted scope of his subject by providing a rhetorical interest of a similar kind. A fragment of Aeschylus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See above, p. xx, n. 5.</note> indicates that his heroes exchanged taunts of the same nature as those which pass between Teucer and the Atreidae. It may be granted that some parts of the scene between Teucer and Menelaüs are wholly repugnant to a modern taste<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Especially vv. 1142—1158.</note>. The best apology for them is that Attic Tragedy was a popular entertainment, and that Athenian hearers not only tolerated but expected sharp personalities in a strenuous debate, however dignified the disputants or the occasion,—as Demosthenes is a witness. But there is no ground for any such suspicion as that of Bergk<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Gr. Lit.</title> vol. III. p. 381. Cp. Bernhardy, <title>Gr. Lit.</title> pt. II. sect. ii. p. 366.</note>, that the latter part of the play is by an inferior poet (such as Iophon , the usual scape-goat),—and has been tacked on to an early play of Sophocles, which stopped, or was left unfinished, at the death of Ajax. A careful and sympathetic study will rather leave a conviction on the mind that both the dramatic treatment and the diction bear the stamp of Sophocles, though some of the details are not in his happiest vein, and though the form of the whole—a prolonged controversy—makes a somewhat exacting demand on the modern <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The test of performance.</note>reader. When the <title>Ajax</title> is seen on the stage,—and this is the proper test,—a modern spectator finds that in the latter part of  it the interest is thoroughly sustained<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The <title>Ajax</title> was performed at Cambridge, by members of the University, in 1882. No result of that experiment was more striking than the decisive proof which it afforded that the <title>Ajax</title>, as a whole, is a thoroughly effective play for the stage, and that its power of holding an audience is not diminished by the death of the hero at a comparatively early moment in the action.</note>. The foreground is full of movement and animation, as Menelaüs, Agamemnon and Odysseus successively appear; while the pathetic group in the background—the child kneeling in supplication by his father's body, with Tecmessa near him—keeps before the mind the significance of the issue which is in suspense. It is then, far more easily than in a mere perusal of the text, that one can view the whole action of the play in a right perspective; and justice is instinctively rendered to the degree in which, here as elsewhere, Sophocles evinces his command over the highest art of the theatre.

<span class="line-ref">Line 17</span><p>A few words may suffice to characterise those minor <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Tecmessa.</note> persons of the drama whose principal function is to bring the central figure into relief. Tecmessa, the daughter of a Phrygian prince, whom the fate of war has given to Ajax, loves him with a submissive devotion, and has won from him a constant affection. He is ‘her dread lord, of rugged might’; standing to her in the place of country, parents, everything; her only stay and hope on earth. She appreciates his great qualities in their obvious aspects. His laments, in his first despair, affright her, because they seem alien from his nature; but she has no insight into the workings of his mind. She is easily lulled into the belief that he has abandoned the purpose of self-destruction, since the only distinct idea which she had connected with it was that of the misery which it would bring upon her. When her fears are suddenly re-awakened, she bitterly cries that she has been ‘deceived.’ To her, the one question had been whether the love that he owed her would prevail on him to live; she had no clear perception of any other motives, that might urge him to die; still less could she measure their force. After his death, her simple loyalty refuses to think of him as crushed by his foes. It is no triumph for them, but a blank loss: the victory is rather his: ‘All that he yearned to win hath he made his own,—the  death for which he longed.’ Death was what he desired, and the gods consented; that is all that she understands, beyond the import for herself<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See vv. 961—973.</note>.</p>
<p>The Salaminians <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Chorus.</note> are the staunch followers of Ajax, true to him in weal or woe, and jealous of his good name, which is their own. He turns to them in his misery, as to tried friends, charging them with his last wishes, and with his message to Teucer. But their leading characteristic is their complete dependence on Ajax, and their utter helplessness when his protection is withdrawn. They are dismayed by the anger of the Greeks, and at one moment even think of seeking safety in flight; they bewail the hardships of the camp, and pine for the delights of home. In thus portraying them, the poet probably intended to suggest the Homeric contrast between the passive common folk (<quote lang="greek">λαοί</quote>) and the ‘Zeus-nurtured’ chiefs. The Salaminians contribute to illustrate the greatness of the hero who had been their ‘defence against nightly terror and the darts of the foe’; even their complainings, however unmeet for warriors, serve to recall the weary stress of those ten years at Troy during which Ajax had been the bulwark of the ungrateful Achaeans.

After his repulse by Telamon, Teucer had founded the new Salamis in Cyprus. On a report of Telamon's death reaching him there, he returned to the old Salamis; but was repelled by Eurysaces, and finally settled among the Gallaeci in the north-west of Spain.

<p>The earliest author of Latin tragedy, the Greek freedman Livius Andronicus, wrote an <title>Aiax Mastigophorus</title>, doubtless founded, as the title indicates, on Sophocles. These words occurred in it:—</p>
<p>Praestatur laus virtuti, sed multo ocius Verno gelu tabescit<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Frag. II. (Ribbeck, p. 2).</note>:</p>
<p>an echo, probably, of the words in the <title>Ajax</title> (vv. 1266 f.),</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">φεῦ· τοῦ θανόντος ὡς ταχεῖά τις βροτοῖς χάρις διαρρεῖ</quote>.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the melting frost (scarcely a happy image for evanescent praise) may have been suggested by <quote lang="greek">διαρρεῖ</quote>. Nothing is known as to the <title>Aiax</title> of Ennius, but one of the two verses which remain from it recalls a passage in the <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Frag. II. (Ribbeck, p. 17): <title>Animam misso sangui tepido tullii efflantes volant.</title> The word <foreign lang="la">tullii</foreign> is explained by Festus as=<foreign lang="la">silani</foreign> (springs), or <foreign lang="la">rivi.</foreign> The sense is then, ‘The warm blood flows,—the streams fly forth, spirting out the life.’ There is a marked resemblance, as Scaliger noted, to   <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 1411" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ai.</title> 1411</bibl> ff., <quote lang="greek">ἔτι γὰρ θερμαὶ | σύριγγες ἄνω φυσῶσι μέλαν | μένος</quote>. The verbal parallelism of <foreign lang="la">efflantes</foreign> with <quote lang="greek">φυσῶσι</quote>, and <foreign lang="la">tepido</foreign> with <quote lang="greek">θερμαί</quote>, strongly suggests imitation.</note>. If we may suppose that Ennius, like Livius Andronicus, based his treatment of the subject wholly or mainly on Sophocles, then there is significance in the fact that the later dramatists, Pacuvius and Attius, each wrote an <title>Armorum Iudicium</title><note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Ribbeck, p. 80 (Pacuvius): p. 154 (Attius).</note>; a title which suggests that the desire to vary from their Latin predecessors sent them back to the <quote lang="greek">Ὅπλων κρίσις</quote> of Aeschylus, and possibly to the play of Theodectes. A fragment from the <title>Armorum Iudicium</title> of Attius belongs to the speech in which Odysseus urged his claim to the arms. The verse which Attius has paraphrased from the <title>Ajax</title> (vv. 550 f.),</p>
<p>Virtuti sis par, dispar fortunis patris,  suggests, however, that he may have imitated Sophocles in other details also; perhaps seeking, by such eclecticism of treatment, to distinguish his work from the earlier <title>Armorum Iudicium</title> of Pacuvius. The rhetorical capabilities of the subject are illustrated by Ovid, whose powers of brilliant and ingenious declamation are seen to considerable advantage in the speeches of Ajax and Odysseus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Metamorph.</title> XIII. 1—398.</note>. His spirited and pointed verse presents a striking contrast to the tame and mechanical treatment of the same episode in the Greek epic of Quintus Smyrnaeus<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Posthomerica</title> v. 181—316.</note>.</p>
<p>The earliest reference in modern literature to the <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles is of sufficient interest to deserve a passing mention here; it occurs in the first scene of <title>Titus Andronicus</title>, v. 379:—</p>
<p>The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son Did graciously plead for his funerals.</p>
<p>As Steevens saw, these lines must have been written (or prompted) by some one who knew the <title>Ajax</title> itself; for no translation of Sophocles existed in the sixteenth century, and the mediation of Odysseus is not mentioned elsewhere. Modern criticism doubts, and with good reason, whether Shakespeare had any part in the <title>Titus Andronicus</title><note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Dowden, <title>Shakspere</title>, p. 54.</note>, though Meres, in 1598, included it among his plays: and in this passage, at all events, we seem to see the work of a playwright who had been at one of the Universities.

<span class="line-ref">Line 20</span><p>It is interesting to inquire how far the influence of the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Illustrations from ancient </note>  Art.poets can be traced in such works of Greek art as are concerned with the tragic end of Ajax. A favourite subject was the actual contest for the arms. Some red-figured vases, of the fifth century B.C., show Ajax and Odysseus vehemently disputing the possession of the prize,—ready, indeed, to rush at each other, while their friends on either side hold them back: Agamemnon, as judge, stands between them. This type seems to have been created, or at least developed, by the vase-painter  <note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">A Duris vase-painting on this subject by  Duris may be seen in Baumeister, <title>Denkmäler</title>, p. 29, plate 30.</note>. But an earlier form of the same subject occurs on black-figured vases of the sixth century B.C. Here there are only the three principal figures,—Ajax, Odysseus, and Agamemnon,—and the <quote lang="greek">ἀγὼν</quote> for the arms approaches still more nearly to the character of a fight. The competitors are advancing against each other with drawn swords, while Agamemnon tries to keep them apart<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">C. Robert, <title>Bild und Lied</title>, p. 217, gives a copy of this scene from a black-figured lekythos in the Berlin Museum.</note>. The black-figured vases prove that the original literary source was not the <quote lang="greek">Ὅπλων κρίσις</quote> of Aeschylus, —as the red-figured vases would have allowed us to suppose,— but some older poem. Other works of art represent the close of the contest. A relief on a sarcophagus found at Ostia<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Figured in Baumeister, p. 29, pl. 31.</note> shows Odysseus seizing the arms which have just been awarded to him, while Ajax, escorted by indignant friends, is retiring, with visible fury in his eyes,—the <quote lang="greek">ὄμματα ἀστράπτοντα</quote> of the <title>Iliupersis</title><note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See above, § 2.</note>.

On a stone in front of the goddess are seen the <quote lang="greek">ψῆφοι</quote> by which the arms have just been adjudged to Odysseus,—a detail which recalls the language of Pindar and Sophocles, who both speak of the award as decided by ballot<note anchored="yes" n="6" place="foot" resp="RCJ">  <bibl default="NO" n="Pind.

<p>The painters Parrhasius and Timanthes (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 400 B.C.) are said to have competed at Samos in an <quote lang="greek">ἀγὼν γραφικός</quote>, the subject of their pictures being Ajax and Odysseus contending for the arms<note anchored="yes" n="7" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Pliny, <title>N. H.</title> 35. 36 § 72: Aelian, <title>V. H.</title> 9. 11. Timanthes gained the prize; when Parrhasius said that he condoled with Ajax on having <emph>for a second time</emph> got the worst of it.</note>. But the famous picture on this subject was by Timomachus of Byzantium<note anchored="yes" n="8" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The date of Timomachus is uncertain. Brunn (<title>Gesch. d. gr. Künstler</title>, vol. II. p. 282) would refer him to ‘the time of the Diadochi’ (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 320—270 B.C.), on account of the tendencies shown in his choice and treatment of subjects. At any rate Pliny is evidently wrong in saying that Timomachus painted in the time of Julius Caesar (<title>N. H.</title> 35. 40 § 30), as he already had the fame of an ‘old master’ in 70 B.C. (  <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Ver. 2.4.60" valid="yes">Cic. <title>In Verr.</title> 2. 4. 60.</bibl>）</note>, whose work was directly inspired by Sophocles. It represented Ajax, as the poet describes him,  sitting among the slaughtered cattle, and brooding on selfdestruction, in that gloomy despair which followed his frenzy<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Philostratus, <title>Vit. Apoll.</title> 2. 22 § 5: see n. below on verse 346.</note>. An epigram in the <title>Anthology</title> attests the vivid impression which this picture made on the beholder<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Jacobs, <title>Anthol.</title> vol. II. p. 648, no. 83: <quote lang="greek">Αἶαν, Τιμομάχου πλέον ἢ πατρός· ἥρπασε τέχνα τὴν φύσιν. ὁ γράψας εἶδέ σε μαινόμενον, καὶ συνελυσσήθη χεὶρ ἀνέρι, καὶ τὰ κεραστὰ δάκρυα τοὺς λύπης πάντας ἔμιξε πόνους</quote>. The style is somewhat affected and obscure. ‘Ajax, Timomachus, not Telamon, is thy sire: Art has made Nature's claim her own! The painter <emph>saw</emph> thee in thy frenzy,— his hand raged with the rage of his hero, and the mingled pigments from his brush have blended all the throes of pain.’ The last words have point; for it was in portraying a <emph>conflict</emph> of emotions that Timomachus peculiarly excelled.</note>. It was kindred in conception to another celebrated work of the same painter, Medea meditating the murder of her children. Both pictures were at Cyzicus in the early part of the first century B.C.; they were purchased by Julius Caesar, and placed in the temple of Venus Genetrix at Rome. Ovid in exile remembered both:— <cit><quote lang="la"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="elegiac"><l>Utque sedet vultu fassus Telamonius iram,</l>

<p>The <title>Tabula Iliaca</title> in the Capitoline Museum contains a small picture, inscribed <quote lang="greek">ΑΙΑΣ ΜΑΝΙΩΔΗΣ</quote>, which probably shows the influence of Timomachus; Ajax is seated in an attitude of deep dejection, and near him lies the severed head of a ram,—a detail taken from the play of Sophocles (vv. 237 ff.)<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See the reproduction of the <title>Tabula Iliaca</title> in Baumeister's <title>Denkmäler</title>, p. 716, pl. 775: the small picture of Ajax is numbered 80 in the plate.</note>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 21</span><p>The date of the <title>Ajax</title> is unknown; but internal <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Date of the play.</note> evidence affords reasons for believing that, if not the earliest of the seven plays, it is the next oldest to the <title>Antigone.</title></p>
<p>(1) The Parodos has the form of an anapaestic marching-song (vv. 134—171), followed by a lyric ode (vv. 172—200), as in the <title>Persae</title>, the <title>Supplices</title>, and the <title>Agamemnon</title> of Aeschylus. This simplest type of Parodos occurs in no other play of Sophocles, though that of the <title>Antigone</title> is akin to it.</p>
<p>(2) Anapaests for the Chorus are interposed in the iambic dialogue (vv. 1163—1167). The only other play of Sophocles in which this occurs is the <title>Antigone</title> (vv. 929—943).</p>
<p>These are (I think) the only clear indications of a relatively early date. Some other points, however, have been urged, and demand consideration here.</p>
<p>(3) It has been noted by G.

Pers. 584" valid="yes"> <title>Pers.</title> 584</bibl> etc.), is not elsewhere used by Sophocles. The <title>Persae</title>, it will be seen, furnishes most of these parallelisms<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">We may also compare  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 789" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title> 789</bibl> f., <quote lang="greek">φέρων...πρᾶξιν</quote> (‘<emph>announcing</emph> his fortune’), with  <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

Pers. 477." valid="yes"> <title>Pers.</title> 477.</bibl></note>. But such coincidences merely show that the <title>Ajax</title> belongs to a period when Aeschylus had a strong influence on the younger poet's style; and we have no means of setting an inferior limit to that period. In so far, then, as the language of the play has an Aeschylean stamp, it seems more accurate to say that this characteristic is entirely consonant with the hypothesis of a relatively early date than to claim it as a separate indication of such a date. With regard to the epic <quote lang="greek">ἦ ῥα</quote> and <quote lang="greek">τοί</quote>, it should be remembered that the play contains several phrases which show a deliberate aim at epic colouring, such as <quote lang="greek">κλυτῶν ἐνάρων</quote> (177), <quote lang="greek">ἑλίκεσσι βουσί, κλυτοῖς αἰπολίοις</quote> (374 f.), <quote lang="greek">οὐλίῳ</quote> (933), <quote lang="greek">πολύτλας</quote> (954), <quote lang="greek">κοίλην κάπετον</quote> (1165), which the poet may have deemed appropriate to a subject taken from the Trojan cycle and concerned with a Homeric hero.</p>
<p>(4) Some critics have thought that only twelve choreutae were used in the <title>Ajax</title>, and infer that the play belonged to a time when Sophocles had not yet raised the number of the Chorus to fifteen<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> Muff Chr., <title>Chorische Technik d. Soph.</title> pp. 52, 78 ff.; and O. Hense, <title>Der Chor. des Soph.</title> p. 5. Nauck adopts this view in the 8th ed. of Schneidewin's <title>Ajax</title>, p. 63, and n. on 892 ff.</note>. The chief ground of this theory is the fact that verses 892—914 and 938—960 (taken together) contain twelve utterances of the Chorus. It is assumed that each utterance represents a single choreutes. But this is an assumption only; and it does not appear a probable one, when it is observed that verses 900—903, and 908—914, are passionate expressions of a feeling common to the whole Chorus, and would naturally, therefore, be given by the whole Chorus. In verses 866—878, again, the attempt to distinguish twelve parts, one for each of twelve choreutae, involves a highly arbitrary process. The mere fact of <quote lang="greek">ἡμιχόρια</quote> being there employed proves nothing; for the use of hemichoria occurs in plays written at a time when the number of the tragic chorus was certainly fifteen (  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Orest. 1258" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Or.</title> 1258</bibl> ff.,  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Alc. 93" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Alc.</title> 93</bibl>—111, <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Alc. 226" valid="yes">Eur. Alc. 226</bibl>—232).</p>
<p>(5) Lastly, it has been supposed that the play was written ‘not long after the introduction of a third actor<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Introd. to Schneidewin's <title>Ajax</title>, p. 64.</note>,’ because three actors are on the scene together only in the prologue (Athena, Odysseus, Ajax), and at the end (Agamemnon, Teucer, Odysseus); Odysseus being silent while Ajax is present (92—117), and Teucer while Agamemnon is present (1318—1373). But it appears very unsafe to assume that these facts indicate an early and tentative stage in the use of the third actor. They may be due simply to the construction of the play and to the requirements of each dramatic situation.</p>
<p>As between the <title>Ajax</title> and the <title>Antigone</title>, the claim to priority would rest with the <title>Ajax</title>, if the form of the Parodos were the test; though the Parodos of the <title>Antigone</title> is also of an early type (see n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 134" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title> 134</bibl>). But much more weight is due to the fact that the <title>Antigone</title>, alone of the seven plays, rigorously adheres to the practice of Aeschylus, in never admitting the division of an iambic trimeter between two or more speakers  (<quote lang="greek">ἀντιλαβή</quote>). This was no trivial detail, but a general rule of composition which materially affected the character of dialogue. When Sophocles at last decided to relax that rule, the result was a marked gain in lightness and rapidity at moments when the dialogue became animated or excited. The fact that he had made this change before he wrote the <title>Ajax</title> seems clearly to indicate that the <title>Ajax</title> is later than the <title>Antigone.</title>

<span class="line-ref">Line 22</span><p>Aristotle's work <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Title.</note> called <quote lang="greek">Διδασκαλίαι</quote> was a chronological list of tragedies and comedies produced at Athens, the list being based on official records contemporary in each case with the production. Similar works were afterwards compiled by Callimachus (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 260 B.C.) and others. The <quote lang="greek">Διδασκαλίαι</quote> of Aristotle and of Callimachus are known to have been still extant in the second century A. NowD. , we learn from the Greek Argument to the <title>Ajax</title> that ‘in the Didascaliae’ the play was styled simply <quote lang="greek">ΑΙΑΣ</quote><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See below, page 4, line 9: <quote lang="greek">ἐν δὲ ταῖς διδασκαλίαις ψιλῶς ΑΙΑΣ ἀναγέγραπται</quote>.</note>. This is conclusive as to the original title; since, whether the Didascaliae meant, be Aristotle's, or one of the later works, in any case the ultimate authority for the statement dates from the time when the play was produced. In the extant manuscripts the title is <quote lang="greek">Αἴας Μαστιγοφόρος</quote> (alluding to the lash which Ajax carries in the first scene); as it is also in the citations by Zenobius (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 130 A.D. ), Athenaeus, and Clement of Alexandria. On the other hand, the Greek Argument states that Dicaearchus (a pupil of Aristotle) called the play <quote lang="greek">Αἴαντος Θάνατος</quote>, which he could scarcely have done if the title <quote lang="greek">Αἴας Μαστιγοφόρος</quote> had already obtained currency. We may infer from these facts that the epithet <quote lang="greek">Μαστιγοφόρος</quote> was added by some Alexandrian scholar whose authority sufficed to establish it as a permanent part of the title. If the object had been merely, as the author of the Argument suggests, to distinguish the play from the <quote lang="greek">Αἴας Λοκρός</quote> of Sophocles, <quote lang="greek">Τελαμώνιος</quote> might have seemed a fitter designation; but doubtless the intention was rather to distinguish it from later dramas on the same subject, such as those of Astydamas, Carcinus and Theodectes.</p>
<p rend="ital">Scene:—Before the tent of Ajax, at the eastern end of the Greek camp, near Cape Rhoeteum on the northern coast of the Troad.  ODYSSEUS is closely examining footprints on the sandy ground.  ATHENA is seen in the air (on the <quote lang="greek">θεολογεῖον</quote>).</p>
<p>According to the rule of the Greek theatre, the side of the scene on the spectator's right represents the home-region,— in this case, that of the Greek camp. To the spectator's left is the region of the open country, stretching east and south from the camp, over the plain of Troy, towards those ‘Mysian highlands’ from which Teucer returns (v. 720). Aristotle speaks of <quote lang="greek">σκηνογραφία</quote> as an invention distinctive of Sophocles ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Poet. 1448b" valid="yes"> <title>Poet.</title> 4</bibl>: see Smith's <title>Dict. of Ant.</title>, new ed., vol. II. p. 816). And the words in v. 4, <quote lang="greek">ἔνθα τάξιν ἐσχάτην ἔχει</quote>, rather suggest that the Greek camp was somehow indicated here,—perhaps with a glimpse of the Hellespont, and of Cape Rhoeteum. It is not known whether the theatre of the fifth century B.C. had <quote lang="greek">περίακτοι</quote>,—those triangular prisms on pivots, with scenery painted on each of their three faces, which served as movable side-scenes. A periaktos on the spectator's right could have been used to show the camp. Or, if this resource was not then available, the purpose may have been effected by painted hangings on the back-wall, which, in the fifth century B.C., was probably a temporary structure of wood. With regard to the change of scene after v. 814, see note on 815.</p></div2></div><span class="line">

<p>These three verses have been rejected (cr. n.), on the ground that, after this promise from Athena, Odysseus had no cause to feel the alarm which he shows in vv. 74 ff., or to ask the question (v. 84) which elicits a renewal of that promise (85). But the poet wished to render the preparation for the hero's entrance as impressive as possible; and chose, therefore, to represent Odysseus—a brave man—as still uneasy, until the assurance given to him had been <emph>repeated</emph> in a yet more explicit and emphatic form.

The followers of Ajax call upon him to come forth from his tent, —where, for some days previously, he had remained in sullen seclusion (194 f.), —and to refute this dire rumour of his onslaught on the cattle. Surely it is a malignant slander. Or is it possible that some angry deity has driven him to such a deed? Assuredly it is abhorrent from his own nature.</p>

While <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῆς ἀμφιρύτου</lemma> would suggest to an Athenian the narrow strait, so familiar to his sight, which divides Salamis from the Attic mainland, the second epithet, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγχιάλου</lemma>, would, as it were, turn his eyes seaward, inviting him to look forth from the shore of Salamis itself towards the Saronic Gulf. Each adjective lends a touch to the picture. This is thoroughly Greek. See, for instance,  <title>I.

But the idea of <emph>wild abundance</emph> would naturally, in this case, be blended with that of the horses <emph>frisking</emph> or <emph>galloping</emph> in freedom on the plain. Hence the difference made by the verbal analysis which we prefer is not one which much affects the picture. —See Appendix.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλλ’ ὅτε γὰρ δὴ … πτήξειαν ἄφωνοι</lemma>. The most probable account of this passage is that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δ)</lemma> should be inserted after <quote lang="greek">αἰγυπιὸν</quote> in 169 (cr. n.). ‘We can do nothing without thee;—<emph>no</emph> (we are helpless), <emph>for</emph>, when they have escaped thine eye, they chatter like flocking birds; <emph>but</emph> (<quote lang="greek">δέ</quote>) terrified by the mighty vulture, perchance they will suddenly cower,’ etc. Note these points:—</p>
<p>(1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλλὰ</lemma> prefaces a confirmation of the statement just made in a <emph>negative</emph> form (165 <quote lang="greek">οὐδὲν σθένομεν</quote>): cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 307" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 307</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐν οὖν τοιούτοις οὔτε σωφρονεῖν, φίλαι</quote>, | <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’ εὐσεβεῖν πάρεστιν, ἀλλ’ ἔν τοι κακοῖς | πολλή )στ’ ἀνάγκη κἀπιτηδεύειν κακά</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλλὰ … γὰρ</lemma> is elliptical; ‘No (we can do nothing), <emph>for</emph>’ etc.: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 223" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 223</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἐν γὰρ δεινοῖς οὐ σχήσω κ.τ.λ.</quote>, ‘but (ye speak in vain), for’ etc.:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 155" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 155</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ὅδε γὰρ δὴ</quote>.. | <quote lang="greek">χωρεῖ</quote>, ‘but (let us cease), <emph>for</emph>’ etc.</p>
<p>(3) The reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μέγαν αἰγυπιὸν δ’ ὑποδείσαντες</lemma>, which allows the words <quote lang="greek">μέγαν αἰγυπιὸν</quote> to <emph>begin</emph> the clause describing the sudden discomfiture of the foes, gives those words a signal force and spirit. They become much tamer, if, deleting <quote lang="greek">ὑποδείσαντες</quote> and the stop after <quote lang="greek">ἀγέλαι</quote>, we  place a comma after <quote lang="greek">αἰγυπιόν</quote>, and govern it by <quote lang="greek">ἀποδρᾶσαι</quote> supplied from <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀπέδραν</lemma>.</p>
<p>(4) This reading is confirmed by the fact that since <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑποδείσαντες</lemma> refers to the foes of Ajax (and not, as the schol. took it, to the birds), there is a change from simile to metaphor: the ‘vulture’ is Ajax.

<p>The sailors ask whether Artemis or Ares can have driven Ajax to such a deed. In connection with their chief, the deities of hunting and war naturally occur to them. They do not think of Athena.</p>
    <p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ταυροπόλα</lemma>=<quote lang="greek">Ταυροπόλος</quote>: for the form, cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. O. 3" valid="yes">Pind. <title>O.</title> 3. 26</bibl><quote lang="greek">Λατοῦς ἱπποσόα θυγάτηρ</quote>:   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 1478" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 1478</bibl><quote lang="greek">Γοργοφόνα</quote>. There were two cults of Artemis, originally quite distinct. (1) The <quote lang="greek">Ταυροπόλος</quote> was a goddess who rules over bulls,—one of the numerous attributes of Artemis in her relation to wild animals: cp. <quote lang="greek">αἰπόλος, ἱπποπόλος, οἰοπόλος</quote>. A Macedonian silver coin (from Amphipolis) shows her riding on a prancing bull, and carrying a torch in either hand. On another coin she appears (with the inscr. <quote lang="greek">ΤΑΥΡΟΠΟΛΟΣ</quote>) carrying two torches, and with the horns of a bull growing out of her shoulders: these horns were meant to suggest the crescent moon. The cult of the Tauropolos was purely Greek, and had nothing fierce or cruel about it. (2) The cult of  Artemis <quote lang="greek">Ταυρική</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">Ταυρώ</quote>) had orgiastic elements; it was of Asiatic origin, and belonged to a primitive stage of natureworship. The ritual was a bloody one, and in early times involved human sacrifice. This was the Artemis whose cult was said to have been brought to Brauron in Attica, from the Tauric Chersonese, by Iphigeneia and Orestes.</p>
<p>It is possible that Sophocles here was thinking <emph>only</emph> of the <quote lang="greek">Ταυροπόλος</quote> proper, and names her simply because bulls had been among the victims of Ajax. On the other hand, the savage nature of the bloody onslaught might suggest that she was associated in his thought with the <quote lang="greek">Ταυρική</quote>. Such an association occurs as early as  <title>I. T.</title> 1457 where the Brauronian Artemis (<quote lang="greek">ἐπώνυμον γῆς Ταυρικῆς</quote>, 1454) is called <quote lang="greek">Ταυροπόλος</quote>. The dithyrambic poet Timotheus of Miletus (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 400 B.C.) addressed the Ephesian Artemis as <quote lang="greek">μαινάδα, θυιάδα, φοιβάδα, λυσσάδα</quote> (Bergk fr. 1).

How the second <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἤ</lemma> should be corrected, is uncertain. (1) In favour of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μή</lemma>, it may be noted that the interrogative <quote lang="greek">μή</quote> is often followed, as here, by <quote lang="greek">τις</quote>, and that its tone of tentative suggestion is just in place. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 9.405" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 9. 405 f.</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἦ μή τίς σεο μῆλα βροτῶν ἀέκοντος ἐλαύνει; ἦ μή τίς σ’ αὐτὸν κτείνει δόλῳ ἠὲ βίηφι;</quote></cit>  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

(3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοί</lemma> would be fitting, indeed, but would require us to suppose that the second <quote lang="greek">ἤ</quote> in the MSS. is an inadvertent repetition of the first, not a corruption of some word like itself. (4) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἴ</lemma> has also been suggested. But the implied construction, <quote lang="greek">μομφὰν ἔχων, εἴ τιν)</quote> (<quote lang="greek">εἶχεν</quote>), would be too harsh. (5) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ</lemma> is condemned by the fact that with Sophocles this interrogative <quote lang="greek">ἦ</quote> regularly stands first in its clause; only a vocative sometimes precedes it: see on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1281." valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 1281.</bibl></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἐνυάλιος</lemma> is in the <title>Iliad</title> either the War-god (2. 651), seemingly identical with Ares, or an epithet of Ares (17. 211 <quote lang="greek">Ἄρης | δεινὸς ἐνυάλιος</quote>). Like <quote lang="greek">Ἐνυώ</quote>, the word is of uncertain (possibly Thracian) origin. The mention of this deity has a two-fold fitness here; (1) on account of the reference in 178 to Artemis Agrotera; for, acc. to Pollux 8. 91, the Athenian Polemarch made annual offerings <quote lang="greek">Ἀρτέμιδἰ Αγροτέρᾳ καὶ τῷ Ἐνυαλίῳ</quote>: (2) because in the island-home of Ajax there was a  <quote lang="greek">ἱερόν</quote> of Enyalios, founded by Solon to commemorate the victory by which Athens wrested Salamis from the Megarians (  <bibl default="NO" n="Plut. Sol. 9" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Sol.</title> 9</bibl>). Further, Enyalios is here supposed to have helped Ajax; whereas Ares usually favoured the Trojans (cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 20.38" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 20. 38</bibl>). As to the Attic relationship between the two deities, see Appendix.

<span class="line-ref">Line 191</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μή, μή μ), ἄναξ</lemma>. If <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μ)</lemma> be sound, it can be only the acc.: an elision of <quote lang="greek">μοι</quote> is impossible (see  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1436" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title> 1436</bibl>, n. in Appendix). And <quote lang="greek">με</quote> could be explained only as depending on the phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κακὰν φάτιν ἄρῃ</lemma>, as meaning, ‘win an evil repute, to my injury’ (<quote lang="greek">μή με διαβάλῃς, αὐτὸς διαβαλλόμενος</quote>): cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

But this is certainly forced; and, though the Chorus afterwards speak of themselves as involved in their chief's peril (252 ff.), that thought is less fitting here.</p>
<p>The simplest remedy is that which is proposed by Prof. v. Wilamowitz-Möllendorff (cr. n.), who, referring to the hiatus after <quote lang="greek">ἄνα</quote> in 193, would here omit <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μ)</lemma>. The syllables <quote lang="greek">μή, μή μ)</quote> answer metrically to <quote lang="greek">μομφὰν</quote> in 180, and we should thus have to suppose that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μή, μή, ἄναξ</lemma> represents <foreign lang="meter">--u-</foreign>. Such an hiatus seems a very doubtful one for tragic lyrics: otherwise the suggestion would be welcome, as <quote lang="greek">μή, μή</quote> is supported by  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 210" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title> 210</bibl><quote lang="greek">μή, μή μ’ ἀνέρῃ</quote>. Morstadt's remedy, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μὴ μηκέτ), ὦναξ</lemma>, (instead of <quote lang="greek">μή, μή μ), ἄναξ, ἔθ)</quote>,) has found much favour, and is satisfactory in itself; but it does not account for the origin of the vulgate.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κλισίαις ὄμμ’ ἔχων</lemma>. The sense required is, ‘keeping thy face hidden in the tent’: so that <quote lang="greek">κλισίαις</quote> is a locative dat. The adv. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὧδ)</lemma> helps to suggest the idea of ‘hidden.’ The objections to the version, ‘keeping thine eyes fixed <emph>on</emph> the tents,’ are, (1) that <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote> could not well stand for <quote lang="greek">ἐπέχων</quote>, and (2) that the seclusion of Ajax  <emph>within</emph> his tent is not then expressed.— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄρῃ</lemma> with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">α</lemma> (=<quote lang="greek">λώβαν</quote> in 181), from <quote lang="greek">ἠράμην</quote>: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 196</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτάρβητα</lemma>, neut. pl. as adverb. I keep this, the reading of the MSS., as Wecklein and Bellermann do. Dindorf strikes out <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὧδ)</lemma> (unwarrantably), and writes <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτάρβητος</lemma>. In an epode, the strophic test is absent, and the logaoedic metre admits of Dindorf's reading. There is, however, a point in favour of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτάρβητα</lemma> which deserves to be noted; viz., that the adverbial neut. pl., though it has no special relation to verbs of <emph>motion</emph>, is, in fact, very often joined with such verbs; and that the phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτάρβητα ὁρμᾶται</lemma> is therefore thoroughly consonant with poetical usage.

<span class="line-ref">Line 198</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καγχαζόντων</lemma>. Dindorf writes <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καχαζόντων</lemma>, on the ground that the form <quote lang="greek">καγχάζω</quote> was not  Attic. (His further change of <quote lang="greek">πάντων</quote> into <quote lang="greek">ἁπάντων</quote> is merely for the sake of equalising this v. with 197 f.) The main facts are these. 1. Aristophanes uses <quote lang="greek">καχάζων</quote> once ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Eccl. 849" valid="yes"> <title>Eccl.</title> 849</bibl>), and also the noun <quote lang="greek">καχασμῶν</quote> (<title>Nub.</title> 1073). 2. It is true that <quote lang="greek">καγχάζω</quote> cannot be proved by metre from any verse earlier than that of Babrius (100. 8 <quote lang="greek">καγχάσας</quote>), and Paulus Silentiarius (6th cent.) in <title>Anth. Pal.</title> 6. 74. 3 (<quote lang="greek">καγχάζουσα</quote>). 3. On the other hand the MSS. have <quote lang="greek">ἀνεκάγχασε</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Rep. 337a" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Rep.</title> 337 A</bibl>, and <quote lang="greek">ἀνακαγχάσας</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Euthyd. 300d" valid="yes"><title>Euthyd.</title> 300 D</bibl>; forms, be it noted, which carry their own commendation, since, in the compound with <quote lang="greek">ἀνά</quote>, the nasal (<quote lang="greek">γ</quote> before <quote lang="greek">χ</quote>) makes pronunciation easier. 4. Lastly, there is the analogy of the Homeric <quote lang="greek">καγχαλάω</quote>. Surely, then, there is no reason to doubt that Sophocles could have used <quote lang="greek">καγχάζω</quote> if he found it metrically convenient.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βαρυάλγητα</lemma>. I follow the MSS. in leaving the hiatus (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 196" valid="yes">cp. 196</bibl>), which here has the special justification of a pause, making it needless to write <quote lang="greek">βαρυαλγήτως</quote> with Dindorf. That the scholiast in L, like the MSS., had the neut. pl., appears from his paraphrase, <quote lang="greek">βαρέα καὶ ἀλγεινά</quote>. Some editors prefer to write <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βαρυάλγητ)</lemma>, which is also metrically possible. The sense is, ‘<emph>fraught with</emph> heavy pain’ to <emph>us</emph>; the <quote lang="greek">ἄλγος</quote> is not the bitter indignation felt by the Greeks. The word occurs only here: and <quote lang="greek">βαρυαλγής</quote> is post-classical.</p>

<p>No tolerable emendation has been made. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἠρεμίας</lemma>, ‘stillness,’ though possible, is very feeble. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εὐμαρίας</lemma> (=<quote lang="greek">εὐμαρείας</quote>), which Nauck adopts, is directly contrary to the sense; for, even <emph>before</emph> the dread rumour arose, the Chorus had been disquieted by the long seclusion and inaction of Ajax (194 f.). <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀμμορίας</lemma>, without some further definition (such as <quote lang="greek">τῆς πρὶν</quote>), would be too vague. And the words <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νὺξ ἥδε</lemma> suggest that there was some mention of <emph>day.</emph> On the whole, the traditional reading, though difficult, is less open to objection than any remedy which has been proposed.</p>
<p>The schol. in L has: <quote lang="greek">γρ. δὲ ἀημερίας ἀντὶ τῆς ἀηδοῦς φορᾶς</quote> (‘unpleasant course’), <quote lang="greek">καὶ ἔσται ὁ νοῦς, ποῖον βάρος ἔλαβεν αὕτη ἡ νὺξ ἀπὸ τῆς προτέρας ἀηδίας;</quote> This explanation of <quote lang="greek">ἀημερίας</quote> by <quote lang="greek">ἀηδοῦς φορᾶς</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἀηδίας</quote> indicates (I think) a reference, not to <quote lang="greek">ἡμέρα</quote>—as if <quote lang="greek">ἀημερία</quote> could mean <quote lang="greek">δυσημερία</quote>—but to <quote lang="greek">ἥμερος</quote>: the original scholium may have had <quote lang="greek">ἀνημερίας</quote> (meant as ‘unkindly fortune’).

As Ajax purposed to <emph>flog</emph> Odysseus (110), the ram which suffers that fate here might naturally be identified with him. The first ram, which is beheaded at once, might then represent Agamemnon; and Menelaüs would here be ignored. On this view, however, there is a discrepancy with verses 97—110, since both the Atreidae are there supposed to be dead, while Odysseus has still to suffer. Here one ram (Agamemnon) is slain, and the other (Odysseus) flogged, in rapid succession.</p>
<p>If the two rams are the two Atreidae, then Odysseus is ignored here. This would be consistent both with vv. 97— 110 and with 298—306. The flogging of the second ram here would correspond with the words <quote lang="greek">τοὺς δὲ δεσμίους | ᾐκίζεθ)</quote> in 299 f. Then came the colloquy of Ajax with Athena (301); after which, he slowly regained his sanity,—before he had inflicted the lash upon Odysseus. That the ‘two rams’ are here the royal <emph>brethren</emph> might be suggested by the analogy of the two eagles in  <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 115." valid="yes"> <title>Ag.</title> 115.</bibl>On the other hand, the special ferocity with which Ajax treats the second ram rather indicates that it represents Odysseus. There would be no point in so distinguishing Menelaüs from Agamemnon. On the whole, it seems most probable that the poet meant Agamemnon and Odysseus, but was careless of strict consistency with vv. 97—110.

He always set forth, laid down as a rule, <quote lang="greek">τοιούσδε γόους <emph>ἔχειν πρὸς</emph> ἀνδρὸς κακοῦ</quote>, <emph>pertain to</emph> him, are characteristic of him. The words, <quote lang="greek">πρὸς ἀνδρὸς κακοῦ κ.τ.λ.</quote>, are equiv. to an adverb with the intrans. <quote lang="greek">ἔχειν</quote>: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, as we can say, <quote lang="greek">γόοι ἀνάνδρως ἔχουσι</quote>, so <quote lang="greek">γόοι ἔχουσι πρὸς κακοῦ ἀνδρός</quote>. This intrans. use of <quote lang="greek">ἔχειν</quote> with phrases of an adverbial kind is frequent with Herodotus; <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> 2. 91 <quote lang="greek">ἀγῶνα γυμνικὸν &lt;*&gt;ιὰ πάσης ἀγωνίης ἔχοντα</quote>, ‘<emph>consisting in</emph> every sort of contest’: see other examples on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 709." valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title> 709.</bibl>—The alternative explanation is, ‘he taught that it (was) the part of a craven <quote lang="greek">ἔχειν γόους τοιούσδε</quote>, to indulge in such laments.’ <quote lang="greek">ἔχειν</quote> would then be used as in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 24.515" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 24. 515</bibl><quote lang="greek">δῆριν ἔχουσι</quote>. But this implies an impossible ellipse of <quote lang="greek">ἐ=ναι</quote> after <quote lang="greek">ἐξηγεῖτο</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βαρυψύχου</lemma>, ‘heavy-hearted,’ lacking the buoyant spirit which quickly rallies itself from despondency. Ajax was emphatically a soldier. (The schol.'s paraphrase, <quote lang="greek">μικροψύχου</quote>, conveys a different idea.) The word occurs nowhere else, <quote lang="greek">βαρυθυμος</quote> being the usual term; but cp. <quote lang="greek">βαρύφρων</quote>, and the post-classical <quote lang="greek">βαρυκάρδιος</quote>. Plutarch illustrates the poet's meaning when he speaks (  <title>Mor.</title>p. 477 E) of men <quote lang="greek">ἐν ὀδυρμοῖς τὰ πολλὰ καὶ βαρυθυμίαις καὶ μερίμναις..διατρίβοντας</quote>. So Heracles says,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1074" valid="yes"> <title>Tr.</title> 1074</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἀστένακτος αἰὲν εἱπόμην κακοῖς</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξηγεῖτ)</lemma>: the word implies authoritative exposition (as of the sacred law by  the <quote lang="greek">ἐξηγηταί</quote>), and suggests the submissive reverence with which Tecmessa listened to her lord.

The word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἥσυχος</lemma> in 325 does not imply <emph>silence</emph>; it contrasts the quietness of his present demeanour with his former frenzy, and with the first vehemence (317) of his grief. His occasional words, or laments (such as <quote lang="greek">ἰώ μοί μοι</quote>, 333), are in a tone which foreshadows the worst.</p>
<p>The verse is rejected by Nauck and others as though it were inconsistent with v. 325, and had been patched up from v. 383. There is no ground for this view. On the other hand, after <quote lang="greek">ἥσυχος</quote> in 325, the fear expressed in 326 would be unintelligible, if no reason were subjoined. Bergk, who joins in condemning the verse, allows that Sophocles is usually careful of logical coherence in  drama (‘pflegt .. sorgfältig zu motiviren’); but suggests that <emph>here</emph> the neglect of it might be ‘a mark of the archaic style’ (<title>Jahr. f.

(The word could mean also ‘to utter prophetically,’ as in Lycophron 6 <quote lang="greek">δαφνηφάγων φοίβαζεν ἐκ λαιμῶν ὄπα</quote>.) Tecmessa has just described both the recent frenzy of Ajax—which she had already pictured in vv. 233 ff.—and his present despair. By <quote lang="greek">διαπεφοιβάσθαι</quote> the Chorus mean that a malign power has taken <emph>permanent possession</emph> of his mind. The mental trouble outlasts the frenzy (279 f.). Both <quote lang="greek">διά</quote>, and the perfect tense, serve to mark this. By <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κακοῖς</lemma> they mean his troubles in regard to the arms of Achilles.

<p>The <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote> is now pushed on through the central door. It was a small stage, but large enough to allow of Ajax being shown surrounded by some of the slaughtered animals. The word <quote lang="greek">πράγη</quote> in 347, and the language of vv. 351 ff., show that the carnage was represented. The other plays in which Soph &lt;*&gt;es has used the eccyclema are the  <title>Antigone</title> (1294, where see n.), and the <title>Electra</title> (1464 f., n.).</p>
<p>Ajax, sitting among his victims, and meditating his own destruction, was the subject of a famous picture by Timomachus of Byzantium. Philostratus (<title>Vit. Apoll.</title> 2. 22 § 5) thus describes it: <quote lang="greek">τὸν Αἴαντα τὸν Τιμομάχου..ἀπεκτονότα τἀν τῇ Τροίᾳ βουκόλια καθῆσθαι ἀπειρηκότα</quote> [cp. v. 325 <quote lang="greek">ἥσυχος θακεῖ</quote>], <quote lang="greek">βουλὴν ποιούμενον καὶ</quote>  <quote lang="greek">ἑαυτὸν διαφθεῖραι</quote>. The picture was at Cyzicus in 70 B.C. (  <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Ver. 2.4.60" valid="yes">Cic. <title>In Verr.</title> 2. 4. 60</bibl>), but was afterwards bought by Julius Caesar for the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome ( <title>N. H.</title> 7. 38 § 126). See Introduction § 20.

<p> This kommos serves, like the last (201—262), as a lyric expression of tragic pathos; after which the situation is further developed, as in the former case, by iambic dialogue. But in one respect this kommos differs from its predecessor. In order to bring the mind of Ajax into fuller relief, the lyrics are given to him alone, while the Chorus and Tecmessa speak only trimeters.</p>
<p>The structure is as follows:—1st strophe 348—355=1st antistr. 356—363: 2nd str. 364—378=2nd ant. 379—393: 3rd str. 394—411=3rd ant. 412—429. For the metres see Metrical Analysis.

OT 146" valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title> 146</bibl><quote lang="greek">σὺν τῷ θεῷ</quote> refers to a particular god (Apollo). But there is an arbitrary rigour in this  doctrine. <quote lang="greek">ὁ θεός</quote> often means ‘the divine power’ generally: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> frag. adesp. 471 <quote lang="greek">ὁ γὰρ θεὸς μέγιστος ἀνθρώποις νόμος</quote>: and 496. 2 <quote lang="greek">πόρρω γὰρ ἑστὼς ὁ θεὸς ἐγγύθεν βλέπει</quote>. And this very phrase, <quote lang="greek">σὺν τῷ θεῷ</quote>, occurs once, at least, in a passage where the context plainly indicates that the sense is general, viz.  Eur. fr. 490 <quote lang="greek">σὺν τῷ θεῷ χρὴ τοὺς σοφοὺς ἀναστρέφειν | βουλεύματ’ ἀεί</quote>.

<p>(1) The antistrophic verses, 423—427 (<quote lang="greek">ἐξερῶ...πρόκειμαι</quote>), appear sound. The changes which have been proposed in them have all been designed to suit some emendation in 405 ff., and would have no probability if verses 423 ff. were considered simply on their own merits.</p>
<p>(2) There is only one real discrepancy of metre between the traditional text here and that of the antistrophe; viz., that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῖσδ)</lemma> in 406 answers to the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τινα</lemma> of <quote lang="greek">οὔτινα</quote> in 424, where the <quote lang="greek">α</quote>, being the last syllable of a verse, could be either long or short, and is here long. (Some, indeed, read <quote lang="greek">οὔτιν’ ἁ</quote>: cr. n.) That is, instead of <quote lang="greek">τοῖσδ)</quote>, we require <foreign lang="meter">u-</foreign>. As to <quote lang="greek">ἐξερέω</quote> in 423, answering to <quote lang="greek">εἰ τὰ μὲν</quote> in 405, we should write <quote lang="greek">ἐξερῶ</quote>. With regard to the <emph>diction</emph> of 405 ff., the most suspicious point is the redundancy <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁμοῦ πέλας</lemma>, suggesting that one of the words was a gloss upon the other.</p>
<p>(3) If, then, we assume that the antistrophe is sound, we may conclude that the fault in the strophe lies within the words <quote lang="greek">εἰ τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλας</quote>. A very slight change will restore the metre, viz. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοιοῖσδ)</lemma> for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῖσδ)</lemma>: cp. the words of Ajax in 453 <quote lang="greek">ὥστ’ ἐν τοιοῖσδε χεῖρας αἱμάξαι βοτοῖς</quote>. There he points to the slain cattle around him; and so he probably does here also. We could then understand the sense to  be: ‘If those things (<quote lang="greek">τὰ μὲν</quote>, his glories in the past) perish, my friends, <quote lang="greek">ὁμοῦ τοιοῖσδε</quote>, <emph>along with</emph> (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, by the slaughter of) such creatures, <quote lang="greek">πέλας</quote>, near me there.’ But <quote lang="greek">πέλας</quote> may have been a marginal gloss (on <quote lang="greek">ὁμοῦ</quote>), which has displaced some other word: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, the poet may have written <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοιοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ βοτοῖς</lemma> (cp. v. 453).</p>
<p>(4) Whatever may have been the original <emph>form</emph> of the words <quote lang="greek">εἰ τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλας</quote>, it is at least highly probable that their general sense was, ‘If my old renown is perishing.’ This is suggested by the other passages where we find the same sequence of ideas,—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the thought of his past glory closely followed by that of his present disgrace; see (1) 421—427: (2) 437—456: (3) 612—621.</p>
<p>(5) Those who believe that the antistrophic verses 423—427 are corrupt have a freer hand for emendation here; and, as will be seen in the Appendix, some of the proposed restorations have been very bold. But such remedies pass into the region of pure guess-work.

In modern poetry, too, it has sometimes been used with tragic pathos. Thus Dante <title>Purg.</title> XIII. 109 <quote lang="it">Savia non fui, avvegna che Sapía Fossi chiamata:</quote> and  <bibl default="NO" n="Shak. r2 2.1">Shakesp. <title>Rich. II.</title> act 2 sc. 1. 73</bibl> (Gaunt) <quote lang="en">O how that name befits my composition! | Old Gaunt indeed; and gaunt in being old</quote> etc. The king asks, <quote lang="en">Can sick men play so nicely with their names? No</quote>, is the reply, <quote lang="en">misery makes sport to mock itself.</quote></p>
<p>The real etymology of <quote lang="greek">Αἴας</quote> is uncertain. Vase-inscriptions show that the original form was <quote lang="greek">Αἴvας</quote>, and Sonne (in Kuhn's <title>Zeitschr.</title> 10 p. 126) compares Indog. <foreign lang="pie">aiva</foreign>, Skr. <foreign lang="sanskrit">eva</foreign> (‘course’）—a derivation which Brugmann approves (<title>Stud. z. griech. u. lat. Gramm.</title> 4. 180). The sense, ‘swift runner,’ would suit <quote lang="greek">Οἰλῆος ταχὺς Αἴας</quote> better than the son of Telamon: and it is not improbable (as Fleischer suggests in Roscher's   <title>Lex.</title>p. 139) that the names of the two heroes, though identical in form, were of distinct origin.

Destiny in some other form brought her father and mother to the grave. The poet did not wish to represent Tecmessa as living with the man who had slain her parents; and so followed, or invented, a legend which ascribed their deaths to a different agency. Throughout this speech, the Homeric scene between Hector and Andromachè is present to the mind of Sophocles. Andromachè's father had been slain by Achilles; her mother, by the visitation of Artemis ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 6.414" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 6. 414</bibl>—428).

When this new fact or thought raises a difficulty in the way of something proposed by the last speaker, then <quote lang="greek">καὶ μήν</quote> acquires an adversative force. Thus here, its literal sense, ‘and verily,’ ‘indeed,’ is tinged by the context with the sense, ‘oh, but,’ or ‘nay, but.’ The effect of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γε</lemma> is to place a slight stress on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φόβοισι</lemma>.

She speaks merely as if (in her undefined ‘fears’) she had left the care of the child to others. Then the blunt and impatient question of Ajax—<quote lang="greek">ἐν τοῖσδε τοῖς κακοῖσιν κ.τ.λ.</quote>—startles her into speaking plainly,—<quote lang="greek">μὴ σοί γέ που δύστηνος κ.τ.λ.</quote></p>
<p>The conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξερρυσάμην</lemma> (cr. n.), ‘rescued,’ would efface this trait of reticence. It is inferred from the scholiast's phrase, <quote lang="greek">τῶν φόβων χάριν ῥύσασθαι θέλουσα ἐξήγαγον</quote>. But <quote lang="greek">ἐξήγαγον</quote> is there the important word, while the words <quote lang="greek">ῥύσασθαι θέλουσα</quote> are merely the scholiast's expansion of the motive implied in <quote lang="greek">φόβοισι</quote>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 554</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐν τῷ φρονεῖν μηδὲν</lemma>: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, before there is any intelligent consciousness of joy or sorrow (555).</p>
<p><emph>554</emph> <emph>b</emph> [<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ μὴ φρονεῖν γὰρ</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign>] Such an unconsciousness is an ‘evil,’ as excluding <quote lang="greek">τὸ χαίρειν</quote>, but ‘painless,’ as exempt from <quote lang="greek">τὸ λυπεῖσθαι</quote>. This verse was probably written in the margin, as a parallel passage to v. 554, and then crept into the text. It may come (as Valckenär thought) from some other play of Sophocles; its tone seems less suggestive of Euripides. That it was a familiar quotation, may be seen from the way in which it is brought in by the novelist Eustathius (or Eumathius), in <quote lang="greek">τὸ καθ’ Ὑσμίνην καὶ Ὑσμινίαν σρᾶμα</quote> (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 1100 A.D. ?), ch. 2 § 7 (<title>Erot. Scriptores</title> vol. II. p. 174 ed. Hercher), <quote lang="greek">τοῦ ἔπους ἐμνήσθην ὡς τὸ μὴ φρονεῖν κάρτ’ ἀνώδυνον κακόν</quote>. It is translated, along with v. 553, in the sentences of Publilius Syrus (<foreign lang="la">c.</foreign> 45 B.C.), 876 f., <quote lang="la">Suavissima haec est vita, si sapias nihil: | Nam sapere nil doloris expers est malum.</quote> But those two verses are doubtless later interpolations in the text of Publilius: they are wanting in the best MS. (Monac. lat. 6292).

The nearest analogy to such a license as <quote lang="greek">ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμός</quote> is afforded by such instances as <quote lang="greek">τὸν ἐμὸν πατέρ’ ἄθλιον</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

Remembering the originally pronominal sense of the art., we may hesitate to affirm that an Attic poet could not have ventured to write <quote lang="greek">ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμός</quote>, meaning, ‘that destroyer of mine.’</p>
<p>No correction is very probable. We cannot read <quote lang="greek">μήθ’ ὁ λυμεὼν ἐμοῦ</quote>, since, though <quote lang="greek">μου</quote> can represent the possessive pron., such a use of <quote lang="greek">ἐμοῦ</quote> would be unexampled. (See Krüger, <title>Gr. Sprachlehre</title>, § 47. 9. 13.) The dat. <quote lang="greek">ἐμοί</quote> is also untenable. It is possible that the poet wrote <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μήτε λυμεὼν ἐμός</lemma>: but the article, if not indispensable, is at least very desirable here.

<span class="line-ref">Line 575</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πολυρράφου … πόρπακος</lemma>. This  must be interpreted by the usage of the poet's day, not by Homeric practice. The <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote> may be seen on shields depicted in Greek vase-paintings; an example is reproduced in Smith's <title>Dict. of Antiquities</title> (3rd ed., vol. I. p. 459, art. <emph>clipeus</emph>). It was a leathern thong, running round the inner edge of the shield, and fixed at intervals of six inches or so by pins or nails, so as to form a succession of loops. The name, <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote>, was derived from these pins (<quote lang="greek">πόρπαι</quote>), which could be taken out, when it was wished to remove the <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote> and so to unfit the shield for immediate use. (It is made a charge against Cleon in   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Kn. 849" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Eq.</title> 849</bibl> that he had dedicated the shields taken at Pylos <quote lang="greek">αὐτοῖσι τοῖς πόρπαξιν</quote>.)</p>
<p>But a loop at the edge of the shield, such as the <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote> offered to the warrior's <emph>hand</emph> ( <title>Helen.</title> 1376 <quote lang="greek">ἐμβαλὼν πόρπακι γενναίαν χέρα</quote>), would not suffice to give him control. Hence, in the vasepainting noticed above, we see the <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote> combined with another contrivance, viz., a <emph>band</emph> (of metal, or wood), placed vertically across the inside of the shield, and furnished at the middle with an arrangement of small bars, forming a support for the arm just below the elbow. This band was the <quote lang="greek">ὄχανον</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ὀχάνη</quote>.—See Appendix.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πολυρράφου</lemma> (‘much, or well, stitched’) is a general epithet for elaborate leatherwork, and is again illustrated by the vase-painting cited above, where ornamental tassels hang from the pins which divide the loops of the <quote lang="greek">πόρπαξ</quote>. In <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Theoc. 25" valid="yes">Theocr. 25. 265,</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πολύρραπτόν τε φαρέτρην</quote></cit>, the epithet probably refers to braiding; quivers were often made of hide or leather.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἑπτάβοιον</lemma>=epic <quote lang="greek">ἑπταβόειον</quote>: see n. on 19. The second part of the compound is not <quote lang="greek">βοῦς</quote>, but <quote lang="greek">βοεία</quote>, ox-hide ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 12.296" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 12. 296</bibl>). The shield was the work of <quote lang="greek">Τυχίος, σκυτοτόμων ὄχ’ ἄριστος</quote>,—so essentially was the currier's art that which it chiefly demanded ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 7.220" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 7. 220</bibl>). Tychios dwelt at <quote lang="greek">Ὕλη</quote>,—probably the Boeotian ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Hence <quote lang="greek">στόμα</quote> cannot be completely translated; and it is the literal sense which should here be sacrificed to the other.

<span class="line-ref">Line 753</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἶρξαι</lemma>. The primitive sense of the root (<quote lang="greek">vεργ</quote>) was to ‘press’: whence come both the meanings of this verb, ‘to shut out,’ and ‘to shut in.’  Acc. to Eustathius (p. 1387. 3) the Attic form was <quote lang="greek">εἴργω</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">κωλύω</quote> (‘shut out’ or ‘hinder’), but <quote lang="greek">εἵργω</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">ἐγκλείω</quote>. Curtius (<title>Etym.</title> § 142) thinks that this distinction was of comparatively late origin. Our MSS. consistently give <quote lang="greek">εἱρκτή, εἱργμός</quote>, ‘a prison.’  Andoc. or. 4 § 27 has <quote lang="greek">εἱργνύων</quote> (‘imprisoning’):   Plat. <title>Tim.</title>p. 45 E <quote lang="greek">καθείργνυσι</quote> (indeed, the forms from <quote lang="greek">ειργνυ</quote> are always aspirated). But in regard to the other forms the evidence of MSS. is often conflicting, and the practice of editors has varied. In Thuc. , Bekker always writers <quote lang="greek">εἵργω</quote>: Classen and Stahl, always <quote lang="greek">εἴργω</quote>, even (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) in 8. 74 § 3 <quote lang="greek">εἴρξειν</quote> and 4. 47 § 3 <quote lang="greek">κατεῖρξαν</quote>, where the ref. is to imprisonment; though in the latter place the MSS. seem to agree on <quote lang="greek">καθεῖρξαν</quote>. On the other hand in   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ba. 443" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Bacch.</title> 443</bibl> the best editions give <quote lang="greek">εἶρξαι</quote>.  Eur. Itmay be noted that Lobeck could find no instance of <quote lang="greek">ἀφείργειν</quote> earlier than Aelian (<title>Hist. An.</title> 12. 21 <quote lang="greek">ἀφειργμένη</quote>): as to <quote lang="greek">ἄφερκτος</quote> in   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 446" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ch.</title> 446</bibl>, he justifies it as meaning, ‘shut in (apart),’ not ‘shut off.’ Recent editors are generally agreed in writing <quote lang="greek">εἶρξαι</quote> here, and <quote lang="greek">εἴργειν</quote> in 795. This is justifiable in any case, the sense being ‘to <emph>restrain</emph>,’ rather than definitely ‘to <emph>shut in.</emph>’</p>

Such mortals are  <quote lang="greek">ἀνόνητοι</quote>,—their lives can yield no worthy fruit. Compare the words of warning addressed to Xerxes ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 7. 10" valid="yes"> Her. 7. 10</bibl>): <quote lang="greek">ὁρᾷς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα ζῷα ὡς κεραυνοῖ ὁ θεὸς οὐδὲ ἐᾷ φαντάζεσθαι..φιλέει γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα πάντα κολούειν</quote>.

<p>It is not without reason, then, that the reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κἀνόνητα</lemma> is supported by the general consensus of ancient testimony. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κἀνόητα</lemma> is adopted by several recent editors, because the <emph>folly</emph> of Ajax is elsewhere recognised (763 <quote lang="greek">ἄνους</quote>, 766 <quote lang="greek">ἀφρόνως</quote>), whereas he could not, they think, be called <quote lang="greek">ἀνόνητος</quote>. But that depends on the point of view. In the sight of the gods, the greatest warrior would be <quote lang="greek">ἀνόνητος</quote>, if he ceased <quote lang="greek">κατ’ ἄνθρωπον φρονεῖν</quote>. Observe, too, that the word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σώματα</lemma> confirms <quote lang="greek">ἀνόνητα</quote>: the idea is that of greatness which, swollen beyond the human limit, has ceased to fulfil the proper function of mankind.

<span class="line-ref">Line 771</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δίας Ἀθάνας</lemma>. The genitive, if sound, is best taken as depending on <quote lang="greek">ἀντιφωνεῖ</quote> in the sense of <quote lang="greek">ἀντίον λέγει</quote>, ‘says to her face.’ In  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1065" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 1065</bibl>, however, this verb takes an acc. of the person, <quote lang="greek">μή μ’ ἀντιφώνει μηδέν</quote>: and no verb of ‘accosting’ affords a parallel to such a constr. as <quote lang="greek">ἀντιφωνεῖν τινος</quote>. Such phrases as those in   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Pers. 694" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title> 694</bibl> f. <quote lang="greek">ἀντία λέξαι | σέθεν</quote> (‘in thy presence’),  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 15.377" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Od.</title> 15. 377</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀντία δεσποίνης φάσθαι</quote>, are not relevant. (In  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 1.230" valid="yes">Hom. <title>Il.</title> 1. 230</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">ὅστις σέθεν ἀντίον εἴπῃ</quote>, the sense is, ‘<emph>against</emph> thee.’）</p>
<p>Other explanations are the following. (1) The poet meant to add something to the effect of <quote lang="greek">ἠτίμασε τὴν παραίνεσιν</quote>, but changed the form of the sentence. (2) <quote lang="greek">Ἀθάνας, ἡνίκα..ηὐδᾶτο</quote> stands for a gen. absol., <quote lang="greek">Ἀθάνας αὐδωμένης</quote>. (3) The gen. depends on <quote lang="greek">ἔπος</quote> in 773, ‘a saying <emph>about</emph> her,’ like <quote lang="greek">μῦθος..φίλων</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 11" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 11</bibl>).</p>
<p>The most attractive remedy is Mehlhorn's, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δίαν Ἀθάναν</lemma>, so that the verb shall have the same constr. as in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1065." valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 1065.</bibl>But, if this be right, how did the genitive arise? Possibly some annotator, who thought that after <quote lang="greek">ηὐδᾶτ)</quote> in 772 the subject of <quote lang="greek">ἀντιφωνεῖ</quote> might be obscure, wrote <quote lang="greek">ΑΙΑΣ</quote> in the margin, and this, mistaken for <quote lang="greek">ΔΙΑΣ</quote>, led to <quote lang="greek">ΔΙΑΣ ΑΘΑΝΑΣ</quote> supplanting <quote lang="greek">ΔΙΑΝ ΑΘΑΝΑΝ</quote> in the text. The occurrence of the same  words in 757 may have helped. [The Homeric fem. is <quote lang="greek">δῖα, δῖαν</quote>. But <quote lang="greek">δία—</quote> occurs in <title>Rhes.</title> 226 <quote lang="greek">Ἄπολλον, ὦ δία κεφαλά</quote>.]</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δίας Ἀθάνας</lemma> be genuine, then corruption may lurk in <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δεύτερον</lemma>: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> the poet may have written <quote lang="greek">εἶτα δ’ ἀντίον</quote>.

No sooner had Calchas finished, than Teucer rose, and sent the messenger, who was close by,—sitting among the <quote lang="greek">λαοί</quote>.  (Cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Some take <quote lang="greek">εὐθὺς ἐξ ἕδρας</quote> as= ‘immediately, <emph>from</emph> his seat,’—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, without rising (so that he would beckon or call the man to him): cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 19.77" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 19. 77</bibl><quote lang="greek">αὐτόθεν ἐξ ἕδρης, οὐδ’ ἐν μέσσοισιν ἀναστάς</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Hence <quote lang="greek">εὐθὺς ἐξ ἕδρας</quote> <emph>ought</emph> to mean, ‘immediately <emph>after</emph> sitting.’— Other explanations of <quote lang="greek">ἐξ ἕδρας</quote> are: (1) ‘from where I (the messenger) sat.’ (2) ‘After the sitting of the council.’ But Teucer would not wait for that. (3) ‘Leaving the council’ (or strictly, its neighbourhood, since Calchas had come apart from it,  Od. 750). This would imply that Teucer had been included in the <quote lang="greek">ξύνεδρος κύκλος</quote>: but the tone used towards him by Menelaüs (1120 <quote lang="greek">ὁ τοξότης</quote>) and Agamemnon (1235 <quote lang="greek">δούλων</quote>) makes this very unlikely.</p>
<p>Teucer sends a messenger, instead of going himself, probably because he hopes that his mediation with the chiefs may do some good. What he dreads is simply that Ajax should leave the tent; and a message could prevent that. He has no cause to suspect that Ajax meditates suicide.

<span class="line-ref">Line 798</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τήνδε δ’ ἔξοδον … φέρειν</lemma>. There is strong reason to think that <quote lang="greek">φέρειν</quote> is genuine, and has the sense of ‘<emph>tending</emph> towards.’ For (1) Sophocles has thus used <quote lang="greek">φέρω</quote> in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 517" valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title> 517</bibl><quote lang="greek">εἰς βλάβην φέρον</quote>: <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 519 f. <quote lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ εἰς ἁπλοῦν | ἡ ζημία μοι τοῦ λόγου τούτου φέρει</quote>: <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 991 <quote lang="greek">ἐς φόβον φέρον</quote>. Cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 1. 10" valid="yes"> Her. 1. 10</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐς αἰσχύνην φέρει</quote>. (2) This sense precisely suits the context here, where the apprehension is <emph>vague</emph>; Calchas had not said <emph>how</emph> the <quote lang="greek">ἔξοδος</quote> was to be fatal, but merely that it was to be prevented, on pain of never again seeing Ajax alive. But <quote lang="greek">ὀλεθρίαν..φέρειν</quote> could not mean, ‘is of fatal tendency.’ Such a fusion of <quote lang="greek">ὀλεθρίαν εἶναι</quote> with <quote lang="greek">φέρειν εἰς ὄλεθρον</quote> is impossible.</p>
<p>Nor can we render: ‘He (Teucer) forebodes that this going-forth, which he announces, will be fatal to Ajax.’ <quote lang="greek">φέρειν</quote> could be said only of the <emph>messenger</emph>— not of the man who sends him. Paley's conjecture, <quote lang="greek"><emph>ἐλπίζω</emph> φέρειν</quote>, meets the point as to <quote lang="greek">φέρειν</quote>, but the change to the first person is too harsh. Bothe's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐλπίζειν φέρει</lemma> (‘Teucer announces that he forebodes,’ etc.) strains both verbs. Enger's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐλπίζει κυρεῖν</lemma> is somewhat tame, and does not seem very probable.</p>
<p>Could <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀλεθρίαν Αἴαντος</lemma> have come from <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Αἴαντος εἰς ὄλεθρον</lemma>? Easily, doubtless, if <quote lang="greek">εἰς</quote> had been lost after <quote lang="greek">‐ος</quote>. I incline to this solution. <quote lang="greek">Αἴαντος εἰς ὄλεθρον</quote> is not only intrinsically better, but also slightly more probable, than <quote lang="greek">ὄλεθρον εἰς Αἴαντος</quote> (the reading of Blaydes in his text), since then <quote lang="greek">εἰς</quote> follows <quote lang="greek">‐ον</quote>, and its unusual position would also tend to prevent its being overlooked. But the place of <quote lang="greek">εἰς</quote> after its case is no objection, since <quote lang="greek">Αἴαντος</quote> is an attributive gen. : see  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Il. 1.134" valid="yes"> Il. 134</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">Τελαμώνιε παῖ</quote>: and n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 267." valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title> 267.</bibl>According to one legend, Thestor was the son of Idmon (<quote lang="greek">ἴδμων</quote>), the seer who accompanied the Argonauts, and whose father was Apollo (schol. Apoll. Rhod. 1. 139). The name <quote lang="greek">Θές‐τωρ</quote> is from the root <quote lang="greek">θες</quote>, ‘desire,’ ‘pray,’ whence <quote lang="greek">θεσσάμενος</quote> (=<quote lang="greek">αἰτησάμενος</quote>,  Archil. fr. 11, etc.), <quote lang="greek">πολύθεστος</quote> ‘much besought’ (Curt. <title>Etym.</title> vol. II. p. 137): meaning, ‘one who prays to the gods.’ <quote lang="greek">Κάλχας</quote> is prob. from <quote lang="greek">καλχαίνω</quote>, one who ‘darkly broods’ on futurity ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 20" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 20</bibl> n.).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὅτ’ αὐτῷ … φέρει</lemma>. The traditional <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὅτ)</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">ὅτε</quote>) seems right. Tecmessa has already heard that the <quote lang="greek">ἔξοδος</quote> is perilous. The new fact which she is now to learn is that ‘<emph>this day</emph>’ must decide the fate of Ajax. If, however, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὅτ)</lemma> be changed to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὃς</lemma>, then this new fact will not be told, unless the words <quote lang="greek">καθ’ ἡμέραν τὴν νῦν</quote> be taken with what follows (<quote lang="greek">ὃς..φέρει</quote>). But they go more naturally with what precedes them (<quote lang="greek">τοῦ..μάντεως</quote>, <foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">μαθών</quote>).</p>
<p>If <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φέρει</lemma> be sound, the subject to it is <quote lang="greek">ἡ ἔξοδος</quote> (798). There is nothing harsh in this, since the <quote lang="greek">ἔξοδος</quote> is the matter uppermost in the minds of the speakers. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φέρει … θάνατον ἢ βίον</lemma> then means, ‘is <emph>fraught with</emph> death or life’: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 109" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 109</bibl><quote lang="greek">εἰ τὸ σωθῆναί γε τὸ ψεῦδος φέρει</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 84" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 84</bibl><quote lang="greek">ταῦτα γὰρ φέρει | νίκην</quote>: <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 1042 <quote lang="greek">χἡ δίκη βλάβην φέρει</quote>. The subject to <quote lang="greek">φέρει</quote> is certainly not <quote lang="greek">ἡμέρα ἡ νῦν</quote>. If Calchas were subject to <quote lang="greek">φέρει</quote>, the verb would mean <quote lang="greek">ἀγγέλλει</quote>: but, for this sense, the subject must be the <quote lang="greek">ἄγγελος</quote> himself, not the sender. There is no parallel for <quote lang="greek">φέρει</quote> as=merely ‘<emph>portends.</emph>’</p>
<p>It is possible that <quote lang="greek">ΦΕΡΕΙ</quote> came, under the influence of <quote lang="greek">ΦΕΡΕΙΝ</quote> in 799, from <quote lang="greek">ΘΡΟΕΙ</quote> (the subject being Calchas): but we should not be warranted in altering the text. Wecklein and Blaydes, reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θροεῖ</lemma>, compare  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1425" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title> 1425</bibl>（<quote lang="greek">τὰ τοῦδε</quote>) <quote lang="greek">μαντεύμαθ), ὃς σφῷν θάνατον ἐξ ἀμφοῖν θροεῖ</quote>.

Phil. 12" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 12</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀκμὴ γὰρ οὐ μακρῶν ἡμῖν λόγων</quote>. Verse 812 seems genuine. The fear which had haunted Tecmessa from the moment when Ajax regained his sanity (326), and which his words had lulled, has been revived by the message of Calchas. The definite expression of that fear, by <quote lang="greek">σπεύδῃ θανεῖν</quote>, is a fitting close to this scene, and prepares for the next.</p>
<p>As to the diction of the verse, three points claim notice. (1) The <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γε</lemma> after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄνδρα</lemma> emphasises, not that word, but the whole clause, <quote lang="greek">ἄνδρα ὃς σπεύδῃ θανεῖν</quote>. Cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 213" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 213</bibl> f., <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 648" valid="yes"> Ant. 648</bibl> f.:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

C.</title> 1278.</bibl>It contrasts <quote lang="greek">ἕδρας</quote> with <emph>his</emph> <quote lang="greek">σπουδή</quote>. (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σπεύδῃ</lemma> is the original reading to which L's points (cr. n.). It generalises the statement. (3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θέλοντας</lemma>, which was written by the first hand in L, is in its turn supported by <quote lang="greek">σπεύδῃ</quote> as against <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θέλοντες</lemma>: for, if the sentiment is general, it will depend on <quote lang="greek">οὐχ ἕδρας ἀκμή</quote> more fitly than on <quote lang="greek">χωρῶμεν</quote>. In  this case, the acc. <quote lang="greek">θέλοντας</quote> depends on <quote lang="greek">οὐχ ἕδρας ἀκμή</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">οὐχ ἱδρυτέον</quote>, a constr. quite possible for poetry: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>Tecmessa now leaves the scene by the entrance on the spectator's left, leading to the open country. The Messenger, with the servants of Ajax, goes out on the spectator's right, as being bound for the Greek camp.</p>
<p>The Chorus leave the orchestra in two <quote lang="greek">ἡμιχόρια</quote>, one by the <quote lang="greek">πάροδος</quote> on the right, the other by that on the left. The withdrawal of the Chorus from the orchestra during the course of a play was called <quote lang="greek">μετάστασις</quote>: their return, <quote lang="greek">ἐπιπάροδος</quote>. The other extant examples are:—(1)  Aesch. <title>Eum.</title>: <quote lang="greek">μετάστασις</quote> at v. 231: <quote lang="greek">ἐπιπάροδος</quote> at v. 299.

<p>A change of scene is now supposed to take place, from the ground in front of the tent of Ajax to a lonely spot on the sea-shore, with trees or bushes (<quote lang="greek">νάπος</quote>, 892). We do not know how this change was managed. (1) It may have been indicated merely by removing the hangings on the back-wall which represented the <quote lang="greek">σκηνή</quote> of Ajax. This is  MA. üller's view (<title>Gr. Bühnenalterthümer</title>, p. 162). (2) Wecklein supposes that a back-wall, representing the <quote lang="greek">σκηνή</quote>, was drawn back on right and left, disclosing the new scene.—We cannot assume the use of <quote lang="greek">περίακτοι</quote> in the poet's time (cp. note at the beginning of the play). Had they been in use, the <quote lang="greek">περίακτος</quote> on the spectator's left could have turned, so as to represent a new locality (<quote lang="greek">τόπος</quote>). The right-hand <quote lang="greek">περίακτος</quote>, indicating the region in which the whole action takes place (<quote lang="greek">χώρα</quote>), would not have been changed.</p>
<p>The only other Greek play in which a change of scene is certain is the <title>Eumenides</title>, where the action begins at the temple of the Delphian Apollo, and passes at v. 235 to that of Athena Polias at Athens. This may have been marked merely by substituting a statue of Athena for one of Apollo.</p>
<p><emph>815</emph> Ajax is standing at the side of the scene on the spectator's right, near the underwood which screens him when he falls—so that his body is not at first visible to the Chorus when they return to the orchestra, but could be seen by Tecmessa, when she comes on the scene from the left. The point of the sword could probably be seen by the audience. Hesychius quotes Polemon, the sophist in Hadrian's age, as saying that the <quote lang="greek">συσπαστὸν</quote> was used <quote lang="greek">ἐν Αἴαντος ὑποκρίσει</quote>. It was a short stage-sword, of which the blade ran back; otherwise called <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρόμητον</quote> (Hesych., which some refer to <quote lang="greek">ἀναδραμεῖν</quote>), or <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρομηρόν</quote>. Cp. Achilles Tatius 3. 20 <quote lang="greek">ὁ σίδηρος εἴσω καταδύεται, τούτῳ δ)...ἐν τοῖς θεάτροις ἐχρῆτο πρὸς τὰς κιβδήλους σφαγάς</quote>.</p>
<p>The antithesis to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁ μὲν σφαγεὺς</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign>  is delayed: it is given by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκ δὲ τῶνδε</lemma> in 823. Meanwhile, the reasons why the weapon should prove deadly have been developed in three clauses (<quote lang="greek">δῶρον μὲν— πέπηγε δ)—ἔπηξα δ)</quote>). Hence <quote lang="greek">ὁ μὲν σφαγεὺς κ.τ.λ.</quote> is resumed in 823 by <quote lang="greek">οὕτω μὲν εὐσκευοῦμεν</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σφαγεὺς</lemma> here is simply ‘the slayer.’ In   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Andr. 1134" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Andr.</title> 1134</bibl><quote lang="greek">σφαγῆς</quote> are sacrificial knives.</p>

<p>The last two of these four verses are certainly spurious, as three things show.</p>
<p>(1) The poet would not have made the dying Ajax pray that the Atreidae may die ‘at the hands of their offspring,’ unless there had been some legend that they so died. But, according to the current mythology, Agamemnon was slain by his wife and her paramour, while Menelaüs and Helen passed, without dying, to Elysium ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 4.561" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title> 4. 561</bibl>). It is only in later times that we meet with the story of Menelaüs and Helen having been sacrificed by Iphigeneia in the land of the Tauri (<bibl default="NO">Ptolemy Heph. 4</bibl>, cp. <bibl default="NO">Roscher, <title>Lex.</title> p. 1951</bibl>): a myth which the author of these verses may have had in view. Odysseus, indeed, was slain by Telegonus; but he does not come into account here, unless we make the improbable change of <quote lang="greek">Ἀτρειδῶν</quote> to <quote lang="greek">Ἀχαιῶν</quote> in 838. [As to the double sense of <quote lang="greek">αὐτοσφαγής</quote>, with ref. to one who is slain (1) by himself, (2) by a kinsman, see on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 56" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 56</bibl><quote lang="greek">αὐτοκτονοῦντε</quote>.]</p>
<p>(2) These two verses confuse the construction, since <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ εἰσορῶσ’ ἐμέ</quote> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">ξυναρπασθέντα</quote>) refers to what precedes: while <quote lang="greek">τὼς</quote> in 841 refers to <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) The form <quote lang="greek">φίλιστος</quote> occurs nowhere else, except as a proper name.</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">τώς</quote> is not elsewhere found in  Soph. or Eur. : it is, however, used by Aesch. , not only in lyrics ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Seven 484" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Th.</title> 484</bibl>, <title>Suppl.</title> 69, 670, 691), but once, at least, in a trimeter,  <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Seven 637" valid="yes"> <title>Th.</title> 637</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἢ ζῶντ’ ἀτιμαστῆρα τὼς ἀνδρηλάτην</quote>. We should not, then, insist on <quote lang="greek">τώς</quote> as a mark of spuriousness: and <quote lang="greek">ὀλοίατο</quote> is, of course, free from objection ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1274" valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title> 1274</bibl><quote lang="greek">γνωσοίατο</quote> n.). But the case against 841 f. seems conclusive without them.</p>
<p>A more difficult question is whether vv. 839, 840 are also spurious. The schol. in L on v. 841 is as follows:—<quote lang="greek">τὼς αὐτοσφαγεῖς</quote>: <quote lang="greek">ταῦτα νοθεύεσθαί φασιν ὑποβληθέντα πρὸς σαφήνειαν τῶν λεγομένων</quote>. As the lemma, <quote lang="greek">τὼς αὐτοσφαγεῖς</quote>, clearly indicates, <quote lang="greek">ταῦτα</quote> refers only to the two verses 841 f., and not (as Dindorf and others have assumed) to all the four verses 839—842. The surmise was, says the scholiast, that vv. 841 f. were added ‘to make the meaning clearer’; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, to explain the elliptical phrase, <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ εἰσορῶσ’ ἐμέ</quote>. Such a surmise itself shows that vv. 839, 840 were believed to be older than 841 f. It is indeed plain that all four verses are not by the same author. The incoherent construction noticed above, under (2), was possible for an interpolator whose attention was fixed on <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ εἰσορῶσ’ ἐμέ</quote>, but hardly for one who was forging vv. 839—842 as a whole. If, then, all four verses are condemned, we must assume two independent interpolations.</p>
<p>I incline to think that the two verses 839 and 840 are genuine; because, otherwise, the imprecation on the <quote lang="greek">πάνδημος στρατός</quote> (844) would follow too abruptly on v. 838. The prayer for the destruction  of his chief foes, uttered in 839 f., leads up to the more sweeping denunciation of the Greek army.

<p> Various theories of interpolation have been held with regard to this passage: see Appendix. Most of them are founded on the assumption that Tecmessa's former speech of ten lines (915—924) must be balanced by a speech of the same length here, and that therefore three of the thirteen verses (961— 973) must be struck out. (Nauck, who rejects 918 f., strikes out five verses here, 966—970.)</p>
<p>As several objections arise from the alleged incoherence of the speech, it is well to observe the train of thought in 961—973.</p>
<p>‘Let them mock, if they will, at the fate of Ajax; they will perhaps find out, in time of need, what they have lost; foolish men never know their own good fortune till they have thrown it away  (961—965). No, his death is no gain for them—though it is anguish for me: for <emph>him</emph>, it is the release which he desired (966—968). Why should they mock at him, then? They cannot even claim that his death was their work; it is the affair of the gods (969 f.). So Odysseus may exult, if he pleases, but it is an empty triumph. He and his friends have merely suffered a <emph>loss</emph>; Ajax is gone, —and has left nothing behind him but the sorrow which is mine’ (971—973).

The fact that <quote lang="greek">πασῶν</quote> has been corrected in L from <quote lang="greek">ἁπασῶν</quote>, the reading of some other MSS., has been regarded as confirming Brunck's conjecture, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁδῶν θ’ ἁπασῶν ὁδὸς ἀνιάσασα δή</lemma>. That reading is specious. In support of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πασῶν</lemma>, however, these points should be considered. (1) <quote lang="greek">ἁπασῶν</quote> could easily arise through the scribe's eye wandering to <quote lang="greek">ἁπάντων</quote> in 992: and no MS. which has <quote lang="greek">ἁπασῶν</quote> alters the order of the words <quote lang="greek">ὁδός θ’ ὁδῶν</quote>. (2) After <quote lang="greek">τῶν ἁπάντων..θεαμάτων ἄλγιστον</quote>, there is a rhetorical advantage in having <quote lang="greek">ὁδός θ’ ὁδῶν πασῶν</quote> rather than <quote lang="greek">ὁδῶν θ’ ἁπασῶν ὁδός</quote>. It is a ‘chiasmus.’ (3) The absence of caesura in <quote lang="greek">ὁδός θ’ ὁδῶν πασῶν</quote> may have been intentional: <ref targOrder="U" target="cl855">see on 855</ref>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀνιάσασα δή</lemma>.

(<quote lang="greek">ἀρήξαντα</quote>) and inf., cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 838" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title> 838</bibl> n.:   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

<p><emph>1008</emph> The ironical <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ που</lemma> (‘methinks’) is reinforced by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴσως</lemma>, which goes more closely with the adjectives (‘radiant and benign, doubtless’). Hermann's change of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴσως</lemma> to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἰδὼν</lemma> weakens the passage.— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐμός θ’ ἅμα</lemma> is clearly right: <quote lang="greek">ἐμός τ’ ἴσως</quote> was a mere error caused by the copyist's eye wandering to the next verse. The use of <quote lang="greek">ἴσως</quote> in the sense of ‘equally’ ( <title>Legg.</title> p. 805 A) is rare.—Teucer's  thought is, ‘Telamon is, indeed, my father no less than thine; but he will not welcome me as a son.’

(2) Sometimes, as here, it denotes a trait of character or disposition; cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

B.C. (<title>C. I. A.</title> IV. 373 f.): the first trace of the <quote lang="greek">γ</quote> form seems to be <quote lang="greek">γναφεῖον</quote>, in an Attic inscr. of 358 B.C. (<title>C. I. A.</title> II. 817 A, 28): Meisterhans, <title>Gramm. d. Att. Inschr.</title> § 23.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔστ’ ἀπέψυξεν βίον</lemma>. The Homeric Achilles slays Hector in fight, and then drags the corpse ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 22.395" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 22. 395</bibl> ff.). Hermann sought to reconcile this verse with Homer by writing, <quote lang="greek"><emph>αἰῶν) εὖτ)</emph> ἀπέψυξεν βίου</quote>: quoting, for <quote lang="greek">αἰῶνα βίου</quote>, the author of a <quote lang="greek">Μελαμποδία</quote> <foreign lang="la">ap.</foreign> Tzetzes on Lycophron 682, <quote lang="greek">Ζεῦ πάτερ, εἴθ’ ἥσσω μὲν ἐμοὶ αἰῶνα βίοιο | ὤφελλες δοῦναι</quote>. There, however, <quote lang="greek">αἰῶνα βίου</quote> means ‘<emph>term</emph> of life.’ Euripides could say, <quote lang="greek">ἀπέπνευσεν αἰῶνα</quote> (fr. 801); but <quote lang="greek">ἀπέψυξεν αἰῶνα βίου</quote> is surely impossible. It would have been better, for Hermann's purpose, to keep <quote lang="greek">αἰέν</quote> and <quote lang="greek">βίον</quote>, merely changing <quote lang="greek">ἔστ)</quote> to <quote lang="greek">εὖτ)</quote>.</p>
<p>As a matter of verbal criticism, it might be observed that <quote lang="greek">αἰέν</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἔστ)</quote> confirm each other. But the defence of the text rests on broader ground. Evidently we must either reject the whole passage 1028 —1039, as Morstadt and Nauck do, or else leave this verse unaltered. For the parallel between the sword and the girdle, as fatal to their respective recipients, would fail altogether, if the girdle had not been an agent of <emph>death</emph> to Hector, but merely of insult to his corpse. It is not known whence Sophocles derived this version, which so strangely mars the very climax of the <title>Iliad</title>; possibly from one of the two Cyclic epics, the <title>Aethiopis</title> of Arctînus or the <title>Little Iliad</title> of Lesches, which related the <quote lang="greek">ὅπλων κρίσις</quote> (see Introd. §§ 2, 3). One thing, at least, seems hardly doubtful. The original motive of this version must have been the same which prompts its use by Sophocles here, —viz., to point the fatal character of Hector's gift to Ajax by connecting a like result with the gift of Ajax to Hector. Two epigrams, attributed to Leontius Scholasticus (<foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 550 A.D. ), turn on the same legend (<title>Anthol.</title> 7. 151, 152): see Appendix.

The view that <quote lang="greek">ὅλων</quote> is <emph>neuter</emph> (<emph>summae rerum</emph>) is decisively condemned (1) by the direct antithesis with the masc. <quote lang="greek">ἄλλων</quote>, and (2) by the absence of the article, <quote lang="greek">τὰ ὅλα</quote> being the invariable phrase in this sense: see, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 19.151" valid="yes">Dem. or. 19 § 151</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὑπὲρ τῶν ὅλων πεισθεὶς εἰρήνην ἄγειν</quote> (‘for the general interests’): or. 22 § 16 <quote lang="greek">τὴν τῶν ὅλων σωτηρίαν</quote>:   <bibl default="NO" n="Xen.

The word <quote lang="greek">ἔπραξαν</quote> used by Ajax in 446 implies some such intrigue. Cp. Pindar's phrase, <quote lang="greek">κρυφίαισι...ψάφοις</quote>, in <title>N.</title> 8. 26 (quoted on 447 ff.). Sophocles doubtless conceived the chiefs as voting by <quote lang="greek">ψῆφοι</quote> placed in urns (cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Eum. 709" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title> 709</bibl>), and this view appears in art (Introd. § 20). Eustathius remarks the anachronism (on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 2.852" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 2. 852</bibl>): though, of course, neither <quote lang="greek">ἐψήφισαν</quote> in 449 nor <quote lang="greek">ψηφοποιός</quote> here necessarily excludes the supposition that the votes were given, in Homeric fashion, by voice.—For other views of <quote lang="greek">ψηφοποιός</quote>, see Appendix.</p>
<p>The gen. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτοῦ</lemma> depends on the phrase <quote lang="greek">κλέπτης ψηφοποιός</quote>, as it might depend on <quote lang="greek">λωβητής</quote> or the like.

The modern name of the cape, <title>Colonna</title> (<quote lang="greek">Κολόνναις</quote>), is derived from the remaining columns of the temple, which are of a brilliant whiteness, the marble of which they are made being of a much lighter colour than the Pentelic. ‘As seen from a distance,  glittering in the sun across the blue sea, they look like pillars of snow or salt, rather than stone’ (Mure, <title>Tour</title> II. p. 123).

<span class="line-ref">Line 1276</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀμφὶ μὲν νεῶν … ἑδωλίοις</lemma>: ‘when fire was now blazing around the quarter-decks of the ships at their sterns (<quote lang="greek">ἄκροισιν</quote>).’ Three points should be noted.</p>
<p>(1) There is strong evidence that the term <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> was used in the 5th cent. B.C. to denote a raised deck, a quarter-deck, at the stern of the ship. This is clear in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 1. 24" valid="yes"> Her. 1. 24</bibl>:  Arion asks leave, <quote lang="greek">στάντα ἐν τοῖσι ἑδωλίοισι ἀεῖσαι</quote>: the officers of the ship consent, and are then said <quote lang="greek">ἀναχωρῆσαι ἐκ τῆς πρύμνης ἐς μέσην νέα</quote>,— leaving  Arion alone on the <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote>. In  <title>Helen.</title> 1571, <quote lang="greek">Ἑλένη καθέζετ’ ἐν μέσοις ἑδωλίοις</quote>: which is clearly a place distinct from that where the rowers sat; of them it is said, <quote lang="greek">τοίχους δεξιοὺς λαιούς τ’ ἴσοι | ἀνὴρ παρ’ ἄνδρ’ ἕζοντο</quote>. (For further evidence on this point, see Appendix.)</p>
<p>(2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄκροισιν</lemma> denotes the position of the <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> at the extremities, or sterns, of the ships. Though the <title>Iliad</title> is not closely followed here, Sophocles may probably have had in mind how the Trojans fired the ship of Protesilaüs <emph>at the stern: </emph> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 16.124" valid="yes"> Il. 16. 124</bibl><quote lang="greek">ὣς τὴν μὲν πρύμνην πῦρ ἄμφεπεν</quote>. In  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 9.241" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 9. 241</bibl> it is said of Hector, <quote lang="greek">στεῦται γὰρ νηῶν ἀποκόψειν ἄκρα κόρυμβα</quote>,—the ‘crowning ensigns’ (<quote lang="greek">ἄφλαστα</quote>, <emph>aplustria</emph>) at the sterns. <quote lang="greek">ἄκροισιν</quote> might also mean ‘topmost,’—the <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> being a <emph>raised</emph> deck. This, however, would suggest rather flames <emph>shooting up</emph> to a great height; but in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 15.716" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 15. 716</bibl> f., where Hector grasps the <quote lang="greek">ἄφλαστον</quote>, it appears that even this can have been only some 7 to 9 feet from the ground, and that the <quote lang="greek">ἴκρια</quote> at the stern (the Homeric equivalent of <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> here) can have stood only about 5 feet from the ground. (See Dr  Warre E. in Smith's <title>Dict. of Ant.</title>, 3rd ed., vol. II. p. 211 <emph>b</emph>, art. <title>Navis.</title>）</p>
<p>(3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ναυτικοῖς</lemma>, after <quote lang="greek">νεῶν</quote>, is pleonastic, if <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> be explained as above; whereas, if <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> meant the rowers' seats, <quote lang="greek">ναυτικοῖς</quote> could mean, belonging to the <quote lang="greek">ναῦται</quote>. This is a fair objection to the interpretation given above. But in reply to it we may observe:—(1) the word <quote lang="greek">ἑδώλια</quote> means ‘dwellings,’ ‘abodes’ in  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. El. 1393" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title> 1393</bibl>,   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 71" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ch.</title> 71</bibl>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Seven 455." valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Theb.</title> 455.</bibl>The nautical sense occurs (apart from  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 1. 24" valid="yes"> Her. 1. 24</bibl>) only here, and in  <title>Helen.</title> 1571,  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Cycl. 238." valid="yes"> <title>Cycl.</title> 238.</bibl>Hence the distinctive epithet is intelligible. (2) Further, as the purport of the passage is to mark the urgency of the danger to the ships, on which the ultimate safety of the Greeks depended, there is excuse for the emphatic iteration, <quote lang="greek">νεῶν —ναυτικοῖς—ναυτικά</quote>.</p>
<p>Other views of the passage, and some emendations which have been proposed, will be found in the Appendix.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1277</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἰς δὲ ναυτικὰ σκάφη … τάφρων ὕπερ</lemma>. The situation described here  does not exactly correspond with anything in the <title>Iliad.</title> Ajax, indeed, distinguishes himself in repulsing the Trojans after they have come over the wall, and on one occasion wounds their leader Hector ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 14.409" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title> 14. 409</bibl> ff.); but this happens before any ship has been set on fire. The supreme crisis in this part of the <title>Iliad</title> is the moment when the Trojans set fire to the ship of Protesilaüs (16. 122); but just then Ajax is driven back (<quote lang="greek">χάζετο δ’ ἐκ βελέων</quote> <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign>); it is Patroclus who, urged by Achilles, then comes to the front, and finally beats back the foe. Nor has the <title>Iliad</title> directly furnished the picture of Hector ‘leaping high’ over the trench.</p>
<p>Sophocles may have had some other source, epic or lyric. But it seems equally possible that he wrote from a general recollection of the <title>Iliad</title>, without caring whether he reproduced its details. Indeed, two verses of the <title>Iliad</title> might alone have sufficed to suggest the picture which he has drawn,—that which says of Ajax, <quote lang="greek">Τρῶας ἄμυνε νεῶν, ὅστις φέροι ἀκάματον πῦρ</quote> (15. 731),—and the verse which describes Hector leading the Trojans from the Greek wall towards the ships,—<quote lang="greek">ᾗ ῥ) ὅ γ’ ὁ λυσσώδης φλογὶ εἴκελος ἡγεμονεύει</quote> (13. 53).

Such a <quote lang="greek">κλῆρος</quote> is called <quote lang="greek">δραπέτης</quote>, ‘a <emph>runaway</emph>,’ because it eludes the ordeal. The allusion is to the story of Cresphontes. After the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus, he, Temenus, and the heirs of Aristodemus agreed to cast lots. The first was to have Argos; the second, Lacedaemon; the third, Messenia. Cresphontes wished to have Messenia. He therefore put a lump of earth, as his <quote lang="greek">κλῆρος</quote>, into the voting urn. It broke to pieces, so that only the two other <quote lang="greek">κλῆροι</quote> came out.

A simpler correction would be, <quote lang="greek">ὁ σ’ ἐκφύσας πατήρ</quote>. But it cannot be assumed that Sophocles must have followed here the same version which he used elsewhere. In his <quote lang="greek">Ἀλήτης</quote>, for example, he appears to have modified the version of the <quote lang="greek">Ὀρεστεία</quote> which he adopts in his <title>Electra</title> (see  <title>El.</title>, Introd., p. xliii, n. 4). The story of Aëropè's detection by Catreus is effective for the purpose here, which is to represent Agamemnon as born of a mother who had sinned before his birth. Nor is that story necessarily inconsistent with the other, that she was false to Atreus, and was drowned by him.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐλλοῖς</lemma>, traditionally explained as ‘mute,’ is a word of unknown origin. In Athen. 277 C this verse is quoted, and the question is raised whether any one before Sophocles had used the word: the answer is a quotation from a <quote lang="greek">Τιτανομαχία</quote> (variously ascribed to Eumêlus or Arctînus), <quote lang="greek">ἐν δ’ αὐτῇ πλωτοὶ χρυσώπιδες ἰχθύες ἐλλοί</quote>: with the comment, <quote lang="greek">ἔχαιρε δὲ Σοφοκλῆς τῷ Ἐπικῷ κύκλῳ</quote>. The form <quote lang="greek">ἔλλοψ</quote> occurs in  <title>Scut.</title> 212 (<quote lang="greek">ἔλλοπας ἰχθῦς</quote>), and as a subst. (‘fish’) in the Alexandrian poets (Lycophron 598, 1375: <bibl default="NO" n="Nic. Alex. 481">Nicander <title>Alex.</title> 481</bibl>). A third form, <quote lang="greek">ἔλλοπος</quote>, is the epithet of <quote lang="greek">ἰχθύς</quote> in Empedocles, v. 12. A desperate etymology is suggested in Athen. 307 C, from <quote lang="greek">ἴλλεσθαι</quote> (as=<quote lang="greek">εἴργεσθαι</quote>) and <quote lang="greek">ὄψ</quote>, ‘debarred from utterance.’ Cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

Eustathius (p. 754. 21) thinks that this touch was suggested to Sophocles by the scornful phrases in which Achilles refers to the  Atreidae, when he speaks of himself as <quote lang="greek">ἀνδράσι μαρνάμενος ὀάρων ἕνεκα σφετεράων</quote>, ‘for their lady-loves' sakes,’—and asks, <quote lang="greek">ἢ μοῦνοι φιλέουσ’ ἀλόχους μερόπων ἀνθρώπων | Ἀτρεῖδαι;</quote> Teucer speaks, at any rate, in the same vein.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀντατιμάσαιμ)</lemma>. The choice lies between this correction by Bothe of L's <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἂν ἀτιμάσαιμ)</quote>, and Elmsley's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔ τἂν ἀτιμάσαιμ)</lemma>. The best reason for preferring <quote lang="greek">ἀντατιμάσαιμ)</quote> is a palaeographical one, viz., that a change of <quote lang="greek">ΟΥΤΑΝ</quote> into <quote lang="greek">ΟΥΚΑΝ</quote> (T into K) is rather less probable than a loss of T in <quote lang="greek">ΟΥΚΑΝ</quote>（<quote lang="greek">Τ</quote>）<quote lang="greek">ΑΤΙΜΑΣΑΙΜ</quote>, seeing that <quote lang="greek">ἀτιμάζω</quote> was a familiar word, while <quote lang="greek">ἀντατιμάζω</quote> was unfamiliar. There is no force in the objection that <quote lang="greek">ἀντ‐</quote> in the compound is unfitting (since Ajax had not ‘dishonoured’ Odysseus); the reciprocity marked by <quote lang="greek">ἀντ‐</quote> is simply that of overt hostility.

This is the first symptom that Agamemnon's resolve has been shaken: he feels dimly that there is a conflict of duties. As a king, he must uphold the common weal, and punish treason (such as Ajax seemed guilty of). It is <quote lang="greek">εὐσεβές</quote> to do that. But what if, in doing so, he violates <quote lang="greek">εὐσέβεια</quote> on another side,—that represented by the <quote lang="greek">θεῶν νόμοι</quote> of which Odysseus spoke (1343)? A somewhat similar utterance of Agamemnon, when perplexed by the demands upon him, occurs in fr. 481: <quote lang="greek">οὐ γάρ τις ἂν δύναιτο πρῳράτης στρατοῦ | τοῖς πᾶσιν εἶξαι καὶ προσαρκέσαι χάριν</quote>.

The context in verses 1355 f. at once proves that the words <quote lang="greek">ἁρετή</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἔχθρας</quote> are genuine; and the article before <quote lang="greek">ἀρετή</quote> confirms <quote lang="greek">τῆς</quote>. As <quote lang="greek">νικᾷ</quote> also is presumably sound, the fault, if any, would have to be sought in <quote lang="greek">πολύ</quote>, for which neither <quote lang="greek">πλέον</quote> nor <quote lang="greek">πάρος</quote> is a tolerable substitute; or else in <quote lang="greek">με</quote>. Now in a reply to the question, <quote lang="greek">ἐχθρὸν ὧδ’ αἰδεῖ νέκυν;</quote> we should expect some reference by Odysseus to his own feeling; and v. 1358 (<quote lang="greek">τοιοίδε μέντοι φῶτες κ.τ.λ.</quote>) further indicates that in the preceding verse he actually did refer to himself. Hence the only correction of <quote lang="greek">με</quote> which would solve the difficulty of the genitive, viz. <quote lang="greek">τὰ</quote>, is unsatisfactory.

Many editors place a colon after <quote lang="greek">ὅμοια</quote>, explaining the phrase as a proverb: ‘It is always so: every man works for himself.’ One of the later scholia gives this view: <quote lang="greek">ὄντως πάντα τὰ ἀνθρώπινα ὅμοια· πᾶς γὰρ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ πραγματεύεται σωτηρίαν</quote>. (Cp. Terence <title>Phormio</title> 264 <quote lang="la">ecce autem similia omnia: omnes congruont</quote> etc.) This may be right; but the somewhat homely proverb seems rather too abrupt here for Sophocles. I still prefer the simpler view that <quote lang="greek">ὅμοια</quote> is adverbial: ‘in all things alike every man works for himself.’ Even in the matter of giving burial to another man a selfish motive enters. For <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὑτῷ</lemma> as dat. of interest with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πονεῖ</lemma>, cp.  <title>H.F.</title> 388 <quote lang="greek">Μυκηναίῳ πονῶν τυράννῳ</quote>.—Some understand, ‘every man does deeds like himself,’—works in his characteristic way,—meaning that Odysseus is, as usual, <quote lang="greek">φίλαυτος</quote>.

Odysseus cannot be allowed to touch the body, or to assist in carrying it to the grave, or to join in pouring the <quote lang="greek">χοαί</quote> at the time of interment. It is this intimate participation which is poetically expressed by the phrase <quote lang="greek">τάφου ἐπιψαύειν</quote>. (Morstadt wished to read <quote lang="greek">νεκροῦ</quote> instead of <quote lang="greek">τάφου</quote>, but this would unduly narrow the sense.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, Odysseus is at liberty to assist in protecting the funeral from interruption by the Greek army. He may be a spectator of the rites, though not a participator; and he may bring with him (<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κομίζειν</lemma>) any one he pleases.

That is, <quote lang="greek">ξύμπρασσε</quote> alludes to the request of Odysseus in 1378 f., <quote lang="greek">συνθάπτειν..καὶ ξυμπονεῖν</quote>, and must therefore refer, in part at least, to something connected with the obsequies —not <emph>solely</emph> to friendly offices of a different kind, such as care for Tecmessa and Eurysaces; though it may include these.</p>

He now directs some of the  Salaminian sailors to go and dig the grave; others are to place the tripod near it; a third detachment is to bring thither the hero's armour from the tent. Tecmessa and Eurysaces are still kneeling beside the corpse (1171 ff.). Verses 1409 ff. mark the moment when the body is lifted from the ground. Then it is borne forth (probably by Teucer and one or more <quote lang="greek">πρόσπολοι</quote>), the Chorus following, before they separate to their several tasks.</p>

There, in the phrase <quote lang="greek">φυσῶντ’ ἄνω πρὸς ῥῖνας</quote>, the context shows that <quote lang="greek">ἄνω</quote> means ‘upward (from the lower part of the body) to the nostrils.’ Here, however, <quote lang="greek">ἄνω</quote> seems to have a more general sense,—‘upward to the surface’ (whether through the nostrils, or from the mouth of the wound). As Ajax must now have been dead for about an hour, the thing described seems impossible.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σύριγγες</lemma>, a vague term (=‘channels’), seems to mean <quote lang="greek">φλέβες</quote>, a word which down to the time of Aristotle (and later) denoted <emph>arteries</emph> as well as <emph>veins</emph>;—<quote lang="greek">ἀρτηρίαι</quote> meaning the <emph>bronchial tubes.</emph> (See Append. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

But here Sophocles cannot have meant by <quote lang="greek">σύριγγες</quote> the bronchial tubes; the epithet <quote lang="greek">θερμαί</quote> clearly points to <quote lang="greek">φλέβες</quote>. In Apoll. Rhod. 4. 1647 <quote lang="greek">σῦριγξ αἱματόεσσα κατὰ σφυρόν</quote> means ‘a vein.’ Another explanation of <quote lang="greek">σύριγγες</quote>, viz. the ‘nostrils,’ may be rejected.

If v. 1416 is a  paroemiac, it cannot be followed by a paroemiac. If, then, v. 1417 is to be retained, v. 1416 must be made into an anapaestic dimeter. Further, v. 1417, as it stands, yields no satisfactory sense. It must be taken in one of two ways: (1) by itself, a colon or stop being placed after <quote lang="greek">θνητῶν</quote>:—‘I speak of Ajax, in the days when he lived’: for the genitive, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The interpolation of v. 1417 may have been prompted by the comparative <quote lang="greek">λῴονι</quote>, and by a wish to find the name of the hero at the close of the play.
