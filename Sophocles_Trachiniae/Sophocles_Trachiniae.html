Schlegel, in his Lectures on Dramatic Literature, goes further still; he pronounces the piece unworthy of its reputed author, and wishes that the responsibility for it could be transferred from Sophocles to some feebler contemporary,—his son, for instance, the ‘frigid’ Iophon<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">A. W. Schlegel, <title>Lect.</title> VII.</bibl> All that he says of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is contained in one short paragraph, and the grounds of the condemnation are indicated only in vague terms. ‘There is much both in the structure and plan, and in the style of the piece, calculated to excite suspicion.’ ‘Many critics have remarked that the introductory soliloquy of Deianeira, which is wholly uncalled-for, is very unlike the general character of Sophocles' prologues.’ ‘Although this poet's usual rules of art are observed on the whole, yet it is very superficially; nowhere can we discern in it the profound mind of Sophocles.’ With regard to the prologue—the only passage which Schlegel specifies—some remarks will be found below, <ref targOrder="U" target="cis22">§ 22.</ref></note>. Yet there has never been a lack of more favourable estimates. In the very year when Schlegel was lecturing at Vienna (1808), Boeckh pointed out the strong family likeness between this and the other six plays<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">A.

During the last half century, with the growth of a better aesthetic criticism in relation to all things Hellenic, a sense of the great beauties in the <title>Trachiniae</title> has decidedly prevailed over the tendency to exaggerate its defects; indeed, the praise bestowed upon it, in these latter days, has sometimes perhaps been a little too indiscriminate. The play is in fact an exceptionally difficult one to appreciate justly; and the root of the difficulty is in the character of the fable. A necessary prelude to the study of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is to consider the form in which the Heracles-myth had been developed, and the nature of the materials available for the dramatist.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 2</span><p>The Argive legends are those which best preserve the primitive Dorian conception of Heracles. They are alloyed, indeed, with later elements, of a political origin. Thus, in order that the Dorian conquerors might have some hereditary title to the land, Heracles was made the son of Alcmena, and, through her, a scion of the Perseidae; Tiryns was his heritage, of which he had been despoiled. Again, the struggles between Argos and Sparta for the headship of Peloponnesus have a reflex in those wars which the Argive Heracles wages in Elis or Messenia. But, when such elements have been set aside, there remains the old-Dorian hero, slayer of monsters, purger of the earth, who triumphs over the terrors of Hades, and brings the apples of immortality from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>
<p>We do not know exactly when the ‘twelve labours’ of Heracles became a definite legend. The earliest evidence for it is afforded by the temple of Zeus at Olympia, about 450 B.C. The twelve labours were there portrayed on the metopes,—six on those of the western front, and six on those of the eastern. All the twelve subjects are known from the existing remains<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The subjects of the western metopes, in order from left to right, were: (1) Nemean lion: (2) Lernaean hydra: (3) Stymphalian birds: (4) Cretan bull: (5) Ceryneian hind: (6) Hippolytè's girdle. Those of the eastern metopes were: (1) Erymanthian boar: (2) Mares of Diomedes: (3) Geryon: (4) Atlas and the Hesperides: (5) Augean stables: (6) Cerberus.—Treu, <title>Ausgrabungen zu Olympia</title>, iv. c. 4: W. Copland Perry, <title>Greek and Roman Sculpture</title>, ch. xxi. pp. 225 ff.</note>. The list agrees, in much the larger part, with twelve labours  enumerated by the Chorus in the <title>Hercules Furens</title> of Euripides<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Her. 359" valid="yes">Eur. <title>H. F.</title> 359—429</bibl>. The exploits there enumerated are:—(1) Nemean lion: (2) Centaurs: (3) Ceryneian hind: (4) Mares of Diomedes: (5) Cycnus: (6) Hesperides: (7) Sea-monsters: (8) Relieving Atlas as supporter of the heavens: (9) Hippolytè's girdle: (10) Lernaean hydra: (11) Geryon: (12) Cerberus. No. 2 in this list,—the fight with the Centaurs at Pholoè,—was merely an episode in the <quote lang="greek">ἆθλος</quote> of the Erymanthian boar, the first subject of the eastern metopes at Olympia. Hence the list of Euripides has really nine <quote lang="greek">ἆθλοι</quote> in common with the temple. The three <quote lang="greek">ἆθλοι</quote> peculiar to the temple are, Stymphalian birds, Cretan bull, and Augean stables; instead of which Euripides has, Cycnus, Sea-monsters, Relief of Atlas. An express mention of the number <emph>twelve</emph>, as the fixed limit to the series of <quote lang="greek">ἆθλοι</quote>, occurs first in Theocr. 24. 81, <quote lang="greek">δώδεκά οἱ τελέσαντι πεπρωμένον ἐν Διὸς οἰκῆν</quote> | <quote lang="greek">μόχθους</quote>.</note>, a play of which the date may be placed about 421—416 B.C. Neither list knows any places, outside of Peloponnesus, except Crete and Thrace; nor does either list recognise any of those later myths in which Heracles symbolises the struggles of Argos with Sparta. In both lists the journey to the Hesperides has lost its original meaning,—the attainment of immortality,—since it precedes the capture of Cerberus. These are some reasons for thinking that a cycle of twelve labours had become fixed in Dorian legend long before the fifth century B.C.<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Preller (<title>Gr. Myth.</title> II. 186) adopts the view that the number of twelve labours had probably been first fixed by Peisander, in his epic <quote lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια</quote>, <emph>circ.</emph> 650 B.C. (cp. below, § 4). Wilamowitz,  <title>Heracles</title>, vol. I. p. 308, regards the cycle of twelve labours rather as the invention of some Dorian poet of Argolis,—perhaps of Mycenae,—who lived not later than the 8th century B.C., and of whose work no trace remains.</note> The Dorians of Argclis were those among whom it first took shape, as the scenes of the labours show. But nothing is known as to the form in which it first became current.</p>
<p>One thing, however, is plain. Although the twelve tasks are more or less independent of each other, the series has the unity of a single idea. Heracles is the destroyer of pests on land and sea, the saviour of Argolis first and then the champion of humanity, the strong man who secures peace to the husbandman and an open path to the sailor: with his club and his bow, he goes forth against armed warriors, or monsters of superhuman  malignity, reliant on his inborn might, and conscious of a divine strain in his blood. This is no Achilles, no image of that chivalry which Aeolian legend had delineated and Ionian poetry adorned; no steeds, swift as the wind, bear his chariot into battle; no panoply of bronze, wrought by Hephaestus, flashes on him, ‘like the gleam of blazing fire, or of the sun as it arises’: in the gentle graces of human existence, in the softer human sympathies, he has no portion; no music of the lyre soothes his rest in the camp; he has never known such tears as came into the eyes of the young Achaean warrior, when the aged king of Troy, kneeling at his feet, kissed the hand that had slain Hector; nor has he anything of that peculiar pathos which is given alike to Hector and to Achilles by the dim presage of an early doom, the uncertain shadow which now and again flits across the meridian of their glory; the golden scales, lifted in the hand of Zeus, have never trembled with the fate of Heracles, for his destiny was fixed before his birth, and is inseparable from his origin,—that he must toil while he lives, and must live until his task has been accomplished. He embodies a sterner ideal; one in which there is less of spiritual charm and of flexible intelligence, but which has a moral grandeur of its own; we might say that relatively to the Ionian view of life it is as the Hebraic ideal to the Hellenic. And this ideal may rightly be called ‘Dorian,’ in the sense that it presumably represents a conception of the primitive Dorian folk, bearing a general stamp which can be traced in historical expressions of the Dorian nature.</p>
<p>That conception appears in only two other sets of legends besides the Argive. And these belong to near kinsmen of the Dorian stock, the Boeotians and the Thessalians.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Boeotian legends.</note>The Boeotian legends concern the birth, childhood, and youth of Heracles. Argive tradition claimed his manhood; and this claim could not be ignored. Nor was it disputed that he sprang from the Argive Perseidae. The Boeotians sought only to reconcile his Argive lineage with a belief that he was born at Thebes. Alcmena, his mother, is the daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae: she is betrothed to her firstcousin Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns. Amphi tryon accidentally kills his uncle, Electryon, and flies, with Alcmena, to Thebes. She requires him, as the condition of their union, to avenge her on the Taphii in western Greece, who have slain her brothers. He sets forth from Thebes to do so. Just before his triumphant return, Zeus visits Alcmena in his likeness, and becomes the father of Heracles. Amphitryon was originally a Theban hero; but the Thebans made him an Argive in order that they might make Heracles a Theban. The name ‘Heracles’ is itself a proof that Argive legend was predominant enough to extort such a compromise. Hera was the goddess of the pre-Dorian Argos. The story of her hatred towards the Dorian Heracles expressed the hostility of her worshippers to the Dorian invaders. But, when the Dorians had conquered, their legendary champion came to be called <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλῆς</quote>, ‘the glorified of Hera’; not in the sense that he had won fame by surmounting her persecutions, or through her final reconciliation to him in Olympus; but in the sense that he was the pride of the city which, though it had changed its earthly masters, was still Hera's—the now Dorian Argos. The old story of her spite against him lived on in poetry, but it had lost its first meaning. It is recorded that an earlier name of ‘Heracles’ had been ‘Alcaeus,’ ‘the man of might’; and traces of this lingered in Boeotia<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Dion Chrysost. or. 31 (p. 615 Reiske) <quote lang="greek">ἐν γοῦν Θήβαις Ἀλκαῖος ἀνάκειταί τις, ὃν Ἡρακλέα φασὶν εἶναι, πρότερον οὕτω καλούμενον</quote>. Preller (II. p. 180) quotes the inscription shown in a Farnesian relief on the tripod which Amphitryon dedicated, in his youthful son's name, to the Ismenian Apollo at Thebes: <quote lang="greek">Ἀμφιτρύων ὑπὲρ Ἀλκαίου τρίποδ’ Ἀπόλλωνι</quote>. Sextus Empir. <title>Adv. dogm.</title> 3. 36 gives a like inscription, also connecting it with a Theban <quote lang="greek">ἀνάθημα</quote>. Diodorus (4. 10) ascribes the change of the hero's name to the Argives: <quote lang="greek">Ἀργεῖοι...Ἡρακλέα προσηγόρευσαν, ὅτι δἰ Ἥραν ἔσχε κλέος, πρότερον Ἀλκαῖον καλούμενον</quote>. According to the popular tradition, this change of name was prescribed by the Delphic oracle, when the hero went thither for purification, after the slaughter of his children at Thebes. (<bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 2.4.12" valid="yes">Apollod. 2. 4. 12</bibl>: <bibl default="NO" n="Ael. VH 2.31">Aelian <title>V. H.</title> 2. 31.</bibl>) <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκείδης</quote> was probably a gentilician name, rather than a patronymic in the narrower sense, as Wilamowitz remarks (  I. Eur. <title>Her.</title>p. 293), adding that <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκαῖος</quote>, the father of Amphitryon, ‘was not invented to explain <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκείδης</quote>,’ since in that case the form would have been <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκεύς</quote>. But Pindar, at any rate, seems to have been thinking of <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκαῖος</quote>, father of Amphitryon, when he wrote <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλέης, σεμνὸν θάλος Ἀλκαι·δᾶν</quote> (<title>O.</title> 6. 68). And on the other hand Suidas, <emph>s. v.</emph> <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκείδης</quote> has <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκέως γὰρ παῖς Ἀμφιτρύων</quote>.—A similar name to <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκαῖος</quote> was <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκάθοος</quote>, a Megarian hero analogous to Heracles. Cp. also <quote lang="greek">Ἀλκμήνη</quote>.</note>.</p>
<p>There, too, as in Argolis, the myth is blended with facts of local warfare; Heracles fights for Thebes against the Minyae of Orchomenus. But the true Dorian Heracles is seen in other parts of the Theban story,—as when he strangles the snakes in his cradle, and slays the lion of Cithaeron. His last act at Thebes is that which he does in the madness sent on him by Hera,—the slaughter of the children borne to him by Megara, daughter of Creon. This Theban tradition was another compromise with Argive legend, which claimed his best years for the twelve labours. How, then, was he to be severed from Thebes, the home of his youth? He must be forced to fly from it, as blood-guilty—the guilt being excused by Hera's visitation. Further, Thebes had to account for the non-existence of Theban nobles claiming a direct descent from him. Therefore he slew his Theban children.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Thessalian legends.</note>Lastly, there are the Thessalian legends. These belong especially to Trachis, the chief town of Malis, and to the neighbouring region of Mount Oeta. Here, too, there is an element of disguised history; Heracles is the friend of Dorians; he works for the honour of Apollo, the god of the Thessalo-Delphic amphictyony; he conquers aliens, like Cycnus, or establishes good relations with them, as with the Trachinian king Ceÿx. But the spirit of an older conception animates one part of the Thessalian legend,—the hero's fiery death on the summit of Oeta, when Zeus receives him into heaven. The journey to the Hesperides was probably an older symbol of immortality attained after toil; but if that fable has the charm of the sunset, the legend of Oeta has the grandeur of the hills.</p>
<p>These three cycles of myth,—the Argive, the Boeotian, and the Thessalian,—alone reveal the true old-Dorian Heracles. The traditions found elsewhere are either merely local, expressing the desire of particular Dorian communities to link their own deeds with his name, as at Rhodes and Cos; or they show the influence of non-Dorian poets, who altered the original character of the story by interweaving it with other threads of folk-lore. Thus in the <title>Trachiniae</title> the legend of Oeta is combined with legends of Aetolia. We shall understand this process better if we consider the place of Heracles in that  portion of Greek literature which precedes the rise of Attic drama.

<p>The parts of the Homeric epics in which these allusions occur are of various ages; and the allusions themselves are derived from various regions,—Argos, the western Peloponnesus, Boeotia, Thessaly, the Dorian colonies in Asia Minor. Several of the passages have a more or less intrusive air; one<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">I refer to  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Speaking generally, we may say that in the  <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title> the Dorian hero is a foreign person.</p>
<p>But this negative result is not the only one which the Homeric notices suggest. They make us feel how difficult it would have been for epic poetry, working in the Homeric spirit, to treat the story of Heracles as a whole. His acts are too incoherent to derive a properly epic unity from his person,— such an unity as the <title>Odyssey</title>, for example, derives from the person of Odysseus. The original Dorian legend of Heracles had, indeed, the unity of a moral idea; but that is not enough for an epic.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 4</span><p>Little is known of the efforts made to solve this poetical problem. The Dorian Peisander, of Cameirus in Rhodes, is named as the author of an epic poem on Heracles, a <title>Heracleia</title><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Bernhardy, <title>Gr. Lit.</title> vol. II. pt 1, p. 338, collects the principal notices of Peisander.</note>. He seems to have confined himself to the ‘labours’ which Heracles performed for Eurystheus; and he was the first poet,  we are told, who gave Heracles the lion's skin and the club<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See n. on <title>Philoctetes</title> 727. The club was no doubt an original trait of the old Dorian legend.</note>. Peisander is usually placed about 650 B.C.; but, according to one view, that date is too early<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The 20th epigram of Theocritus is an inscription in hendecasyllables for a Rhodian statue of Peisander, who, with respect to the deeds of Heracles, is called <quote lang="greek">πρᾶτος τῶν ἐπάνωθε μουσοποιῶν</quote>. Wilamowitz (  I. Eur. <title>Her.</title>p. 309), acknowledging the genuineness of the epigram, nevertheless suggests that the name of Peisander may have been a mere invention of the Asiatic Dorians in the 3rd cent. B.C., and holds that the <quote lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια</quote>. ascribed to him was not older than the 6th cent. B.C. According to Theocritus, Peisander described Heracles <quote lang="greek">τὸν λεοντομάχαν, τὸν ὀξύχειρα,...χὥσους ἐξεπόνασεν εἶπ’ ἀέθλους</quote>.</note>. In the Alexandrian age he enjoyed a high repute.</p>
<p>The Ionian Panyasis<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The penultimate syllable of this Carian name is probably long; another, perhaps more correct, form of it was <quote lang="greek">Πανύασσις</quote>. Little weight can be attached to the fact that Avienus, writing about 370 A.D. , has <title>Panyăsi</title> at the beginning of a hexameter (<bibl default="NO" n="Arat. 175">Arat. <title>Phaen.</title> 175</bibl>).</note> of Halicarnassus,  <emph>circ.</emph> 480 B.C., also <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Heracleia</title> of Panyasis.</note> composed a <title>Heracleia</title>, in no less than fourteen books. He took a wider range than Peisander's, and aimed at a comprehensive digest of all the principal legends concerning Heracles. Merits of style and arrangement made him popular; but he did not reach the Homeric level, or work in the Homeric spirit<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See the testimonies in Bernhardy, <title>Gr. Lit.</title> II. pt 1, p. 340.</note>. Possibly his large composition, with its survey of heroic deeds in many lands, may have borne some analogy to the great proseepic of his younger kinsman, Herodotus. That kinship interests us here, since it increases the probability that the epic of Panyasis may have been known to the author of the <title>Trachiniae.</title></p>
<p>But to minds in sympathy with Homeric epos it would be evident that there was another way of dealing with the theme of Heracles; a way different from that of Peisander, and still more different from that of Panyasis. Some one episode might be singled out from the mass of legends, and developed by itself, as an epic on a small scale. Hesiod and the Hesiodic school worked thus; they produced, for instance, the <title>Marriage-feast of Ceÿx</title>, relating how Heracles was entertained by that king of Trachis; the <title>Aegimius</title>, turning on the league of Heracles with that Dorian prince; and the extant <title>Shield of Heracles</title>, concerning his fight with Cycnus.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 5</span><p>Lyric poetry also, from an early time, had been busied with these legends. The Ionian Archilochus (<emph>circ.</emph> 670 B.C.) composed a famous hymn to the victorious Heracles. It was known as the <quote lang="greek">καλλίνικος</quote><note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Pind.

But it was in the choral form, a distinctively Dorian creation, that lyric poetry rendered its loftiest <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Stesichorus.</note>tributes to the son of Alcmena. Stesichorus of Himera, a city in which Dorian and Chalcidic elements were blended, gave the  spirit of Homeric epos to his choral hymns (<emph>circ.</emph> 620 B.C.). Into this new mould he cast three exploits of Heracles,—the triumphs over Geryon, Cycnus, and Cerberus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Bergk, <title>Poet. Lyr.</title> III. p. 207</bibl>.</note>. Pindar's range of allusion <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Pindar.</note> covers almost the whole field of the hero's deeds; but it is in the first Nemean ode that the original significance of the legend is best interpreted. When the infant has strangled the snakes sent by Hera, the Theban seer Teiresias predicts his destiny; how he shall destroy ‘many a monstrous shape of violence’ on land and sea; subdue the men ‘who walk in guile and insolence’; beat down the Earth-born foes of the gods; and then, for recompense of his great toils, win everlasting peace in the blest abodes, and, united to Hebè, ‘dwell gladly in the divine home of Zeus<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Pind. N. 1" valid="yes">Pind. <title>Nem.</title> 1. 60—72</bibl>.</note>.’</p>
<p>For readers of the <title>Trachiniae</title> this lyric literature has one <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Deianeira associated with Heracles.</note> point of peculiar interest. It is there that we can first trace the association of Heracles with Deianeira. The Dorian Heracles had no original connection with the old heroic legends of Aetolia. The stamp of those legends, and their relation to others, indicate that they come from a pre-Dorian time, when Calydon and Pleuron, surrounded by fertile lands and blooming vineyards, were the strongholds of a chivalry devoted to war and to the chase; a chivalry from which popular tradition derived the images of Deianeira, of her parents Oeneus and Althaea, and of her brother Meleager. The story that Heracles had married Deianeira expressed the desire of immigrants, who had displaced the old Aetolian order, to claim kinship with the Dorian invaders of Peloponnesus.</p>
<p>Pindar, in a lost poem,—of what class, is unknown,—told the story somewhat as follows<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. on <title>Iliad</title> 21. 194. The schol. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 8.368" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>8. 368</bibl> probably has the same passage in view when he quotes Pindar as saying that Cerberus had a hundred heads.</note>. Heracles, having gone down to Hades for Cerberus, there met the departed Meleager, who recommended his sister Deianeira as a wife for the hero. On returning to the upper world, Heracles went at once to Aetolia, where he found that Deianeira was being wooed by the river-god Acheloüs. He fought with this formidable rival,—who wore the shape of a bull,—and broke off one of his horns. In order to  recover it, Acheloüs gave his conqueror the wondrous ‘cornucopia’ which he himself had received from Amaltheia, daughter of Oceanus. Heracles presented this, by way of <quote lang="greek">ἕδνα</quote> or ‘brideprice,’ to Oeneus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Strab. 10.458" valid="yes">Strabo 10, p. 458.</bibl>.</note>, and duly received the hand of the king's daughter.</p>
<p>Long before Pindar, Archilochus had related how Heracles overcame the tauriform suitor<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol. <title>Il.</title> 21. 237.</note>, and won the fair maiden; how, after their marriage, Heracles and Deianeira dwelt with Oeneus at Calydon, until they were obliged to leave the country, because Heracles had accidentally slain the king's cupbearer; and how, at the river Evenus, the Centaur Nessus offered insult to the young wife, and was slain by her husband<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol.

<span class="line-ref">Line 6</span><p>Such, then, was the position of the Heracles-myth at the time when Attic Tragedy was advancing to maturity. This legend had become the common property of Hellas; and its primitive meaning had been, to a great extent, overlaid by alien additions or embellishments. Particular episodes had been successfully treated in epic poetry of the Homeric or Hesiodic school, and also in lyrics, both Ionian and Dorian. But the whole legend had not been embodied in any poem which took rank with the foremost creations of the Greek genius.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comedy.</note>As a person of drama, Heracles made his first appearance in Comedy. It was the Dorian Epicharmus who, in the first half of the fifth century B.C., thus presented the Dorian hero to Syracusan audiences. One of the pieces concerned Heracles in quest of the Amazon's girdle; another dealt with his visit to the jovial Centaur Pholos<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλῆς ὁ ἐπὶ τὸν ζωστῆρα</quote>: <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλῆς ὁ παρὰ Φόλῳ</quote>.

The Dorians of Sicily, though Dorian  to the backbone in most things, had a strain of humour and vivacity which tempered the seriousness of their race; in this instance, it was much as if an Irish dramatist of English descent had applied a similar treatment to St George and the dragon.</p>
<p>That Ionians should feel the grotesque side of Heracles, was natural enough. Aristophanes tells us that this hero had become a stock-character of Attic comedy, and claims credit for having discarded him:—</p>
<p>‘It was he that indignantly swept from the stage the paltry ignoble device ‘Of a Heracles needy and seedy and greedy, a vagabond sturdy and stout, ‘Now baking his bread, now swindling instead, now beaten and battered about<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Pax</title> 741 ff., translated by Mr B.

<p>Several comedies on Heracles are known by their titles, or <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Satyrdrama.</note> by fragments. His powers of eating and drinking seem to have furnished a favourite point. He also figured much in satyrdrama,—a kind of entertainment which welcomed types of inebriety.

His contemporaries, Ion of Chios, and Achaeus, wrote each a satyr-play called <title>Omphalè</title>, depicting Heracles in servitude to the Lydian task-mistress. In Ion's piece, he performed prodigies with a ‘triple row of teeth,’ devouring not merely the flesh prepared for a burnt-offering, but the very wood and coals on which it was being roasted<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">For the <quote lang="greek">Ὀμφάλη</quote> of Achaeus, see Nauck <emph>op. cit.</emph> p. 754: for that of Ion, p. 735, esp. <bibl default="NO">fragments 28, 29, 30.</bibl></note>.

Heracles, visited with madness by Hera, slays his children,—in whose fate the Attic poet involves Megara, probably because, with his plot, it was not easy to dispose of her in any other way. Now, as we saw, this Theban story was framed to explain why Heracles, in early manhood, forsook Thebes for Argolis. The murder is discordant with the general tenour of the Heracles myth, and the discord is but thinly concealed by the resort to Hera's agency. For Euripides, however, this very discord was an attraction. It allowed him, by a bold change of detail, to put a new complexion on the whole story. That change consisted in placing the terrible deed of Heracles not before, but after, his labours for Eurystheus.</p>
<p>The plot is briefly as follows. Heracles has long been absent from Thebes, toiling for Eurystheus; and it is known that he is now engaged in the supreme ordeal,—the quest of Cerberus. Meanwhile a certain  Lycus from Euboea becomes master of Thebes, and slays Creon. Megara, her three sons, and the aged Amphitryon, are also doomed by him. They are about to die, when Heracles suddenly returns from the nether world, and kills Lycus. He then holds a sacrifice, to purify the house. While engaged in it, he is stricken with madness. He slays Megara and his children. On recovering his senses, he resolves to commit suicide. But Theseus appears,—the king of Athens whom Heracles has just delivered from Hades. Theseus combats his resolve, offering him an honourable refuge in  Attica. Heracles at last accepts the offer, and departs with his friend.</p>
<p>This, then, is the goal of the great career; this is the result of the strength given by a divine sire, and spent in benefiting men. The evil goddess of Heracles triumphs utterly; at the very moment when his labours are finished, and when, as the old faith taught, his reward was near, he is plunged into an abyss of misery. He passes from our sight, to hide the remainder of his days in the seclusion of a land not his own. Yet, even in this extremity, he has given a proof of strength; he has had the courage to live. He has taught us that, though the mightiest human efforts may end in outward failure, yet no man, if he be true to himself, need suffer moral defeat. Zeus has been faithless to his human son, and Hera's infra-human malevolence has prevailed; but one consolation for humanity remains.</p>
<p>Such is the new reading of the Heracles myth which Euripides has propounded; with admirable power and subtlety, though scarcely with complete artistic success. His interpretation, though full of a deep suggestiveness, is, in fact, too modern for the fable on which it is embroidered.

It has been held that the bold example of Euripides, in making Heracles the subject of a tragedy, induced Sophocles to do likewise<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Wilamowitz, <emph>op. cit.</emph> p. 383.</note>. As to this view, we can only say that it is quite possible, but that there is absolutely no proof of it. On the other hand, one thing is certain: the <title>Trachiniae</title> exhibits a conception and a treatment fundamentally different from those adopted in the <title>Mad Heracles.</title></p>
<p>Two principal elements enter into the mythic material used  <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The two mythic elements.</note>by Sophocles. The first is the Aetolian legend of Deianeira, whom Heracles rescues from Acheloüs, and in whose defence he slays the Centaur Nessus. This part of the subject had been treated by Archilochus and Pindar. The second element is the Thessalian legend which set forth the love of Heracles for Iolè,—his murder of Iphitus, leading to his servitude under Omphalè,—his capture of Oechalia,—and his death upon Mount Oeta. Here the epic <title>Capture of Oechalia</title> was presumably the chief source. Pherecydes and Panyasis were also available. Hesiodic poems, such as the <title>Marriage-feast of Ceÿx</title>, may have supplied some touches.   Ionof Chios, too, had written a drama called <title>Eurytidae</title><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Nauck, <title>Trag. Frag.</title> p. 734.</note>, but its scope is unknown. Nor can we say whether Sophocles was the first poet who brought the Aetolian and the Thessalian legend into this connection.</p>
<p>The Argive and Boeotian legends are left in the background of the <title>Trachiniae;</title> they appear only in a few slight allusions. But, if we are to read the play intelligently, the drift of these allusions must be understood. We must endeavour to see how Sophocles imagined those events of his hero's life which precede the moment at which the play begins.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Later digests of the Heracles legends.</note>Later mythographers, such as Apollodorus and Diodorus, sought to bring a fixed chronology into the chaos of legends concerning Heracles. They framed a history, which falls into six main chapters, thus:—(1) The Theban legends of the hero's birth and growth. (2) The Argive legends of the twelve labours. (3) The legends concerning Eurytus, Iolè, Iphitus, and Omphalè. (4) Campaigns against Troy, Cos, Peloponnesian foes of Argos, and the Giants. (5) The Aetolian legends: Deianeira, Acheloüs, Nessus. (6) The legends of South Thessaly: Ceÿx of Trachis, Aegimius, etc.; the capture of Oechalia; and the pyre on Oeta.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Freedom of the fifth century poets.</note>But, in the fifth century B.C., poets were as yet untrammelled by any such artificial canon. They could use the largest freedom in combining local legends of Heracles, so long as they were careful to preserve the leading features of the myth. We have seen that Euripides, when in his <title>Mad Heracles</title> he placed the madness <emph>after</emph> the labours, was making an innovation which deranged the whole perspective of Theban and Argive legend;  so much so, that the Alexandrian mythographers, deferential to the Attic dramatists in much, never followed Euripides in that.</p>
<p>Sophocles has made no change of similar importance. Yet <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Sequence of events in the <title>Trachiniae.</title></note> his way of arranging the fable differs in one material respect from that of the later compilers. They, as we have seen, place the marriage of Heracles with Deianeira very late in his career— after his labours for Eurystheus, and after most of his other deeds also. Sophocles puts the marriage much earlier,—so early, that Deianeira speaks as if it had preceded most, or all, of the hero's labours. Sophocles could do this, because he felt himself free to ignore the Theban legend of the hero's marriage to Megara. And he certainly was not alone in thus differing from the later mythographers. Pausanias mentions a tradition at Phlius, according to which Heracles had already won his Aetolian bride when he went for the golden apples<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 2. 13. 8." valid="yes">Paus.2. 13. 8.</bibl></note>. And Pherecydes represented Heracles as having at first asked Iolè's hand, not for himself, but for Hyllus—his son by Deianeira<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schol.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 9</span><p>The outline of the whole story, as Sophocles conceived <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The antecedents of the plot.</note> it, can now be traced with clearness sufficient, at least, to explain the hints scattered through the play.</p>
<p>1. Heracles is born at Thebes (v. 116), and comes thence (v. 509), in early manhood, to Pleuron, where he wins Deianeira. We are not told whither he was taking his bride, when they met Nessus (v. 562). Since Megara is ignored, there is nothing to exclude the supposition that he was returning to his home at Thebes.</p>
<p>2. Constrained by Hera's wrath, he performs the labours for Eurystheus (v. 1048). The home of his family is now at Tiryns.</p>
<p>3. He visits Eurytus at Oechalia in Euboea (v. 262); who discountenances his passion for Iolè (v. 359)<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The oblique <quote lang="greek">ῥαίοιτο</quote> in v. 268 leaves an ambiguity. If the word used by Eurytus to Heracles was <quote lang="greek">ἐρραίου</quote>, the labours for Eurystheus were over. But if it was <quote lang="greek">ῥαίει</quote>, they were still in progress. The second supposition gives more force to the passage.</note>.</p>
<p>4. He goes on various campaigns, including that against the Giants (1058 ff.).</p>
<p>5. He slays Iphitus (the son of Eurytus), who was then his guest  at Tiryns. The lapse of some considerable time since his visit to Eurytus is implied by the word <quote lang="greek">αὖθις</quote> (v. 270).</p>
<p>Heracles, with Deianeira, his children, and his mother Alcmena, is now forced to leave Tiryns. They are given a new home at Trachis by its king, Ceÿx (v. 38).</p>
<p>6. As a punishment for the treacherous murder of Iphitus, Zeus dooms Heracles to serve Omphalè, in Lydia, for a year (v. 274). Heracles goes forth from Trachis, leaving his family there (v. 155). They do not know his destination. During his absence, some of his children return with Alcmena to Tiryns; others are sent to his old home at Thebes (1151 ff.).</p>
<p>7. The year with Omphalè being over, he sacks Oechalia (v. 259).</p>
<p>We are now prepared to follow the plot of the drama itself.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 10</span><p>The scene is laid before the house at Trachis.</p>
<p>Deianeira is alone with a female slave, an old and attached domestic, who has been the nurse of her children. Communing with her own thoughts, rather than directly addressing her attendant, the wife of Heracles recalls the sorrows which have been her portion from youth upwards,—culminating now in a terrible anxiety concerning her absent lord. It is fifteen months since he left home; but no tidings have come from him. And she feels almost sure that something is amiss, when she thinks of a certain tablet which he left with her...</p>
<p>Here the aged Nurse ventures to interpose. Deianeira has several sons; why should not one of them,—Hyllus, for example, the eldest,—go in search of his father?</p>
<p>Just then Hyllus himself is seen approaching, and in haste; for he has news to tell. Heracles is, or soon will be, in Euboea, warring against Oechalia, the city of Eurytus. During the past year he has been in servitude to Omphalè, a Lydian woman.</p>
<p>Deianeira then tells her son the purport of the tablet to which she had previously alluded. It contains an oracle, which shows that this war in Euboea must decide the fate of Heracles; he will die; or he will thenceforth live in peace.</p>
<p>Hyllus at once resolves to join his father in Euboea, and departs for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Chorus now enters: it consists of fifteen Trachinian  maidens, full of kindly sympathy for the Aetolian princess <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 94—140.</note> whom a strange destiny has brought to dwell among them. Invoking the Sun-god, they implore him to reveal where Heracles now is. Deianeira, they hear, is pining inconsolably. Fate vexes, while it also glorifies, her husband; but he is not suffered to perish. Let her keep a good courage: sorrow comes to all mortals, but joy also, in its turn; and Zeus is not unmindful of his children.</p>
<p>Deianeira sadly replies that the young maidens cannot <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 141—496.</note> measure such trouble as hers; may they ever be strangers to it! But they shall know her latest and worst anxiety. When Heracles left home, he told her that, if he did not return at the end of fifteen months, she must account him dead. He even explained how his property was to be divided in that event. But, if he survived the fifteenth month, then he would have a peaceful life. Such was the teaching of an oracle which he had written down at Dodona. And the fulfilment of that oracle is now due ...</p>
<p>A Messenger is seen coming; the wreath on his head betokens glad tidings. Heracles lives, is victorious, and will soon come home. Lichas, the herald, has already arrived; but the excited Trachinians, thronging around him, have retarded his progress towards the house.</p>
<p>With an utterance of thanksgiving to Zeus, Deianeira calls upon the maidens of the Chorus and the maidens of her own household to raise a song of joy.</p>
<p>The Chorus respond with a short ode, in the nature of a <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">205—224.</note> paean.</p>
<p>Before it ceases, Lichas is in sight; a train of captive Euboean women follows him.</p>
<p>In reply to the eager questions of his mistress, Lichas says that Heracles is now at Cape Cenaeum in Euboea, engaged in dedicating a sanctuary to Zeus. These maidens are captives, taken when Oechalia was destroyed: Heracles chose them out ‘for himself and for the gods.’</p>
<p>And then Lichas tells how Heracles has been employed during the past fifteen months; how, for a year, he was the slave of Omphalè; and how, when freed, he avenged that  disgrace upon its ultimate author, Eurytus. Heracles himself, the herald adds, will soon arrive.</p>
<p>Deianeira rejoices, though a shadow flits across her joy as she looks at the ill-fated captives: may Zeus never so visit <emph>her</emph> children!</p>
<p>Among these captives, there is one who strangely interests her; the girl's mien is at once so sorrowful and so noble. She questions her; but the stranger remains silent. ‘Who is she, Lichas?’ But the herald does not know,—indeed, has not cared to ask. Deianeira then directs him to conduct the captives into the house.</p>
<p>She herself is about to follow him, when the Messenger, who had first announced the herald's approach, begs to speak with her alone.</p>
<p>He tells her that Lichas has deceived her. The mysterious maiden is no other than Iolè, the daughter of Eurytus. A passion for Iolè was the true motive of Heracles in destroying Oechalia. Eurytus had refused to give him the maiden. Lichas himself had avowed this to the Trachinians.</p>
<p>Lichas now re-enters, to ask for Deianeira's commands, as he is about to rejoin his master in Euboea. Confronted with the Messenger, and pathetically adjured by Deianeira, he confesses the truth. Heracles has an absorbing passion for Iolè; and, indeed, he gave no command of secrecy. But Lichas had feared to pain his mistress: let her pardon him; and let her bear with Iolè.</p>
<p>Deianeira requests Lichas to accompany her into the house. He is to take a message from her to Heracles, and a gift.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon: 497—530.</note>In the ode which follows, the Chorus celebrates the resistless power of Love,—the power which now threatens Deianeira's peace, and which, in long-past days, brought Heracles to contend for her with Acheloüs. The short but vivid picture of that combat has a singular pathos at this moment of the drama.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 531—632.</note>Deianeira reappears. She has had time now to feel what it will be to live under the same roof with the young and beautiful girl to whom her husband has transferred his love; but she harbours no angry or cruel thoughts. Her sole wish is to regain the heart of Heracles. And a resource has occurred to her.  Long ago, when Heracles was taking her from Aetolia, they came to the river Evenus, where the ferryman, the Centaur Nessus, carried her across. He insulted her, and Heracles shot him with an arrow. As he lay dying, he told her that, if she wished to possess a love-charm by which she could always control the love of Heracles, she had only to collect some of the blood from his wound. She had done so, and had preserved her treasure, according to the Centaur's direction, in a place secluded from the warmth of sun or fire. She had now applied this lovecharm to the inner surface of a festal robe, which she will send as her gift to Heracles. She brings with her a casket, in which she has placed the robe.</p>
<p>Lichas appears, ready to depart, and receives the casket, sealed with Deianeira's signet. She had vowed, she tells him, to send her lord this robe, whenever she should hear of his safety, in order that he might wear it on the day when he made a thank-offering to the gods. Therefore Heracles must not put it on, or produce it, before that day.</p>
<p>The herald promises fidelity, and departs.</p>
<p>In a joyous strain, the Chorus express their bright hope. <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon: 633—662.</note> The dwellers on the coasts and hills of Malis will soon welcome the long-absent hero; and he will come home full of rekindled love for his true wife.</p>
<p>But Deianeira now returns to them in an altered mood. A <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 663—820.</note> strange thing has happened. In applying the love-charm to the robe, she had used a tuft of wool, which she had then thrown down in the courtyard of the house. After a short exposure to the sun's heat, this tuft of wool had shrivelled away, leaving only a powder. And she remembers that the arrow which slew Nessus was tinged with a venom deadly to all living things. She fears the worst. But she is resolved that, if any harm befalls Heracles, she will not survive him.</p>
<p>The Trachinian maidens are speaking faint words of comfort, when Hyllus arrives from Euboea.</p>
<p>He denounces his mother as a murderess. He describes how Heracles, wearing her gift, stood forth before the altar; how, as the flames rose from the sacrifice, the robe clung to him, as if glued, and spasms began to rend his frame; how, in the frenzy  of those awful agonies, he slew Lichas; and how, at last, he was laid in a boat, and conveyed to the shore of Malis. He will soon be at the house,—alive, or dead.</p>
<p>The son ends with terrible imprecations on his mother. She goes into the house without a word.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon: 821—862.</note>‘Behold,’ cry the Chorus, ‘how the word of Zeus has been fulfilled; for the dead do indeed rest from labour.’ The malignant guile of Nessus has found an unconscious instrument in Deianeira. And the goddess Aphroditè has been the silent handmaid of fate.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode: 863—946.</note>A sound of wailing is heard within: the aged Nurse enters. Deianeira has slain herself with a sword; bitterly mourned, now, by her son Hyllus, who has learned, too late, that she was innocent.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon: 947—970.</note>The Trachinian maidens, afflicted by this new calamity, are also terrified by the thought that they must soon behold the tortured son of Zeus. Footsteps are heard; men, not of Trachis, are seen approaching, the mute bearers of a litter: is Heracles dead, or sleeping?</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Exodos: 971— 1278.</note>As the mournful procession enters, Hyllus, walking beside the litter, is giving vent to his grief, while an old man, one of the Euboeans, is vainly endeavouring to restrain him, lest his voice should break the sick man's slumber.</p>
<p>Heracles awakes. At first he knows not where he is; then his torments revive, and he beseeches the bystanders to kill him; he craves that mercy from his son; he appeals for it to Zeus and to Hades. And then, in a moment of respite, his thoughts go back on his past life,—so full of suffering, yet a stranger to such anguish as this; so full of victories, and yet doomed to end in this defeat at the unarmed hand of a false woman.</p>
<p>A pause permits Hyllus to announce his mother's death, and to assert her innocence. In using the supposed love-charm, she was obeying the dead Nessus.</p>
<p>Those words send a flash of terrible light into the mind of Heracle&lt;*&gt;. The oracle at Dodona had foretold the time of his ‘release.’ A still earlier oracle had foretold the manner of his death; namely, that he was to be slain by the dead. The time and the agency coincide. This, then, was the promised ‘release.’  The oracles are fulfilled. He sets himself to prepare for death, —now seen to be inevitable and imminent.</p>
<p>He commands that he shall be carried to the summit of Mount Oeta, sacred to Zeus, and there burned alive. Hyllus is constrained to promise obedience,—making, however, the condition that he himself shall not put hand to the pyre<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The office of kindling the pyre was performed by Philoctetes; see on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 802" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>802</bibl> f.</note>. A second behest is then laid upon him. He shall marry Iolè. In this also he is forced to yield,—calling on the gods to witness that he submits to a dying father's inexorable will.</p>
<p>All has now been made ready. Heracles summons the forces of that ‘stubborn soul’ which must upbear him through the last of his ordeals. In the words which close the play, Hyllus gives utterance to the deepest and bitterest of the feelings inspired by his father's cruel fate. Heracles dies forsaken by Zeus. For here, as in the <title>Iliad</title>, there is no presage of his reception among the gods.</p>
<p>The bearers lift their burden, and set forth for Oeta; while the maidens of the Chorus pass from the house of mourning to their own homes in Trachis.

The heroine of the <title>Trachiniae</title> has been recognised by general consent as one of the most delicately beautiful creations in literature; and many who feel this charm will feel also that it can no more be described than the perfume of a flower. Perhaps in the poetry of the ancient world there is only one other woman who affects a modern mind in the same kind of way,—the maiden Nausicaa. We do not know how Deianeira may have been drawn by Archilochus or Pindar; but at least there are indications that the Deianeira of the old Aetolian legend was a being of a wholly different type from the Sophoclean. After her story had become interwoven with that of Heracles, her name, <quote lang="greek">Δηϊάνειρα</quote>, was explained to mean, ‘the destroyer of <emph>a husband.</emph>’ But, in the pre-Dorian days when Aetolian legend first knew her, and when she had as yet nothing to do with Heracles, ‘Deianeira’ meant ‘the slayer of <emph>men</emph>’; it denoted an Amazonian character,—just  as the Amazons themselves are called <quote lang="greek">ἀντιάνειραι</quote>. A true bred princess of Aetolia, the land of warriors and hunters, this daughter of Oeneus ‘drove chariots, and gave heed to the things of war<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">As Apollodorus says of her, 1. 8 § 1: <quote lang="greek">αὐτὴ δὲ ἡνιόχει καὶ τὰ κατὰ πόλεμον γ)/σκει</quote>.</note>’; her pursuits were like those which employed ‘the armed and iron maidenhood’ of Atalanta.</p>
<p>How great a contrast to the Deianeira whom Sophocles has made immortal! She, indeed, is a perfect type of gentle womanhood; her whole life has been in her home; a winning influence is felt by all who approach her; even Lichas, whose undivided zeal is for his master, shrinks from giving her pain. But there is no want of spirit or stamina in her nature. Indeed, a high and noble courage is the very spring of her gentleness; her generosity, her tender sympathy with inexperience and misfortune, are closely allied to that proud and delicate reserve which forbids her—after she has learned the truth about Iolè—to send any messages for her husband save those which assure him that her duties have been faithfully fulfilled, and that all is well with his household. From youth upwards she has endured constant anxieties, relieved only by gleams of happiness,—the rare and brief visits of Heracles to his home. She is devoted to him: but this appears less in any direct expression than in the habitual bent of her thoughts, and in a few words, devoid of conscious emphasis, which fall from her as if by accident. Thus the precepts of Nessus had dwelt in her memory, she says, ‘as if graven on bronze.’ And why? Because they concerned a possible safeguard of her chief treasure. Staying at home, amidst her lonely cares, she has heard of many a rival in those distant places to which Heracles has wandered. But she has not allowed such knowledge to become a root of bitterness. She has fixed her thoughts on what is great and noble in her husband; on his loyalty to a hard task, his fortitude under a cruel destiny: of his inconstancies she has striven to think as of ‘distempers,’ which love, and the discipline of sorrow, have taught her to condone.</p>
<p>But at last the trial comes in a sharper form. After protracted suspense, she is enraptured by tidings of her husband's  safety; and almost at the same moment she learns that his new mistress is henceforth to share her home. Even then her sweet magnanimity does not fail. Strong in the lessons of the past, she believes that she can apply them even here. She feels no anger against Iolè, no wish to hurt her; nay, Iolè is rather worthy of compassion, since she has been the innocent cause of ruin to her father's house.</p>
<p>In these first moments of discovery, the very acuteness of the pain produces a certain exaltation in Deianeira's mind. But, when she has had more time to think, she feels the difference between this ordeal and everything which she has hitherto suffered. She is as far as ever from feeling anger or rancour. But will it be possible to live under the same roof, while, with the slow months and years, her rival's youth grows to the perfect flower, and her own life passes into autumn? Thinking of all this, she asks—not, ‘Could <title>I</title> bear it?’—but, ‘What woman could bear it?’</p>
<p>She, whose patient self-control has sustained her so long, has come to a pass where it is a necessity of woman's nature to find some remedy. Neither Iolè nor Heracles shall be harmed; but she must try to reconquer her husband's love. Having decided to use the ‘love-charm,’ she executes the resolve with feverish haste. The philtre is a last hope—nothing more. With visible trepidation, she imparts her plan to the Chorus. The robe has just been sent off, when an accident reveals the nature of the ‘love-charm.’ ‘Might she not have surmised this sooner,’ —it may be asked,—‘seeing from whom the gift came?’ But her simple faith in the Centaur's precepts was thoroughly natural and characteristic. Her thoughts had never dwelt on <emph>him</emph> or his motive; they were absorbed in Heracles. Now that her hope has been changed into terror, she tells the maidens, that, if Heracles dies, she will die with him. In the scene which follows, she speaks only once after Hyllus has announced the calamity, and then it is to ask where he had found his father.</p>
<p>Her silence at the end of her son's narrative,—when, with his curse sounding in her ears, she turns away to enter the house,— is remarkable in one particular among the master-strokes of tragic effect. A reader feels it so powerfully that the best acting  could scarcely make it more impressive to a spectator. The reason of this is worth noticing, as a point of the dramatist's art. When Hyllus ends his speech, we feel an eager wish that he could at once be made aware of his mother's innocence. The Chorus gives expression to our wish:—‘Why dost thou depart in silence?’ they say to Deianeira: ‘Knowest thou not that thy silence pleads for thine accuser?’ And yet that silence is not broken.</p>
<p>There is one famous passage in Deianeira's part which has provoked some difference of opinion; and as it has a bearing on the interpretation of her character, a few words must be said about it here. It is the passage in which she adjures Lichas to disclose the whole truth regarding Iolè. He need not be afraid, she says, of any vindictiveness on her part, towards Iolè or towards Heracles. She knows the inconstancy of the heart, and the irresistible power of Erôs; has she not borne with much like this before<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Vv. 436—469.</note>? According to some critics, she is here practising dissimulation, in order to draw a confession from Lichas; her real feeling is shown for the first time when, a little later, she tells the Chorus that the prospect before her is intolerable (v. 545). This theory used to derive some apparent support from an error in the ordinary texts. The lines, or some of them, in which the Messenger upbraids Lichas with his deceit, were wrongly given to Deianeira,—as they are in the Aldine edition. Hence La Harpe could describe the whole scene thus:—</p>
<p>‘Deianeira, irritated, reproaches Lichas with his perfidy; she knows all, and will have him confess it; we hear the cry of jealousy; <emph>she becomes enraged; she threatens.</emph> Then <emph>she pretends to calm herself</emph> by degrees; ‘she had resented only the attempt to deceive her; for, in fact, she is accustomed to pardon her husband's infidelities.’ In the end, she manages so well that Lichas no longer feels bound to conceal a fact which after all,—as he says,—his master himself does not conceal<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Quoted, with approval, by M. Patin, <emph>Études sur les tragiques grecs</emph>, vol. 11. p. 72.</note>.’</p>
<p>It is now generally recognised that Deianeira says nothing  between verse 400 and verse 436: the angry altercation is between Lichas and the Messenger. It would still be possible, however, to hold that, in her speech to Lichas, she is artfully disguising her jealousy. But surely there is a deeper truth to nature in those noble lines if we suppose that she means what she says to Lichas just as thoroughly as she means what she afterwards says to the Chorus. Only, when she is speaking to Lichas, she has not yet had time to realise all that the new trial involves; she overrates, in all sincerity, her own power of suffering. If, on the other hand, her appeal to him was a stratagem, then true dramatic art would have given some hint, though ever so slight, of a moral falsetto: whereas, in fact, she says nothing that is not true; for she <emph>does</emph> pity Iolè; she <emph>has</emph> borne much from Heracles; she does <emph>not</emph> mean to harm either of them. This is not the only instance in which Sophocles has shown us a courageous soul, first at high pressure, and then suffering a reaction; it is so with Antigone also, little as she otherwise resembles Deianeira<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Antigone</title>, p. xxx.</note>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 12</span><p>The Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title> may be considered in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Heracles.</note> two distinct aspects,—relatively to that conception of the hero which he represents, and relatively to the place which he holds in the action of the play.</p>
<p>In the first of these two aspects, the most significant point is the absence of any allusion to the hero's apotheosis. He is the son of Zeus; but the ‘rest from labour’ which Zeus promised him is, in this play, death, and death alone. Here, then, we have the Homeric conception of Heracles. And this is in perfect harmony with the general tone of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The spirit in which the legend of Heracles is treated in this play is essentially the epic spirit.</p>
<p>But if the very soul of the old Dorian tradition—the idea of immortality crowning mortal toil—is wanting, at least some archaic and distinctive traits of the Dorian hero have been preserved. One of these has perhaps not been noticed; it illustrates the poet's tact. In the legends of south Thessaly, Heracles had come to be much associated with Apollo. Yet in  the <title>Trachiniae</title> there is but one mention of Apollo,—where the Chorus briefly invokes him (v. 209). Throughout the play, Zeus is the god of Heracles, the ruler of his destiny, the sole recipient of his offerings. Nor is Delphi ever named; Heracles receives oracles either directly from Zeus, or from the interpreters of Zeus at Dodona. This is thoroughly true to the spirit of the myth; and it is probable that the Dorian conception of Heracles was, in fact, older than the Dorian cult of Apollo<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Apollo is the chief god of the Dorians in the historical age; and O. Müller (<title>Dor.</title>, bk 11.) regards him as having been so before they left their earliest seats in northern Greece. On the other hand Wilamowitz (<bibl default="NO">Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1. p. 265</bibl>) holds, with greater probability, that the adoption of the old Hellenic Apollo by the Dorians dated only from the time when, moving southward, they became masters of Delphi.</note>. The archaic conception of the hero's mission is also preserved in its leading features; he is the purger of land and sea, the common benefactor of Hellenes, who goes uncomplainingly whithersoever his fate leads him. Conscious of his origin, he fears no foe, and is stronger than everything except his own passions. He has a Dorian scorn for lengthy or subtle speech (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1211" valid="yes">1121</bibl>). It is bitter to him that sheer pain should force him to cry aloud: and he charges Hyllus that no lament shall be made by those who stand around his pyre. All this is in the strain of the old legend. One small touch recalls, for a moment, the Heracles of the satyr-plays (v. 268, <quote lang="greek">ἡνίκ’ ἦν ᾠνωμένος</quote>). On the other hand, the Omphalè incident, one of their favourite topics, is touched with delicate skill: Sophocles alludes only to the <emph>tasks</emph> done for her by the hero, as a punishment imposed by Zeus; there is no hint of sensuous debasement; and it is seen that the thrall was stung by his disgrace, even though that feeling was not the mainspring of his war upon Oechalia.</p>
<p>The Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is thus not merely <emph>a</emph> hero of tragedy, who might equally well have been called, let us say, Ajax. He has a stamp of his own; he can be recognised as the hero of the Dorians.</p>
<p>When, however, he is considered under the second of the two aspects indicated above,—that is, relatively to his place in the action of the play,—there is more room for criticism. During the first two-thirds of the piece, our interest is centred  in Deianeira. The sympathy which she wins is complete; she passes from the scene, broken-hearted, innocent, silent; and presently we hear the news of her death. Meanwhile, we have been rather prepossessed against Heracles; he is a great hero; but his conduct to this brave, devoted, gentle wife has been what, in another than the son of Zeus, might be called brutal; and let no one too hastily assume that such a feeling is peculiar to the modern mind; it would probably have been shared, at least in a very large measure, by the poet's Athenian audience.</p>
<p>So, when, in the last third of the play, this hero at length appears, unstrung and shattered by physical torment,—helpless in the meshes of fate,—when we listen to his pathetic laments, and to that magnificent recital of his past achievements which ends with the prayer that he may live to rend his false wife in pieces;—then we feel, indeed, all that is pitiable and terrible in this spectacle: but are there not many readers who, if they carried the analysis of their own feelings any further, would have to avow that the contemplation of his suffering and the thought of his past greatness leave them comparatively cold? Presently he learns that Deianeira was innocent, and that she is dead; but he utters no word in revocation of his judgment upon her,—no word of affection for her memory: he merely averts all his thoughts from her, and concentrates them on the preparation for death. It is not enough to plead that any softening would be out of keeping with the situation or with the man; we do not require him to be tender, but to be human. From a dramatic point of view, the fault is that he misses his chance of removing a great impediment to sympathy.</p>
<p>The Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is dramatically effective in the very highest degree,—in a manner almost unique; the Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, though grandly conceived, falls short of being perfectly effective; and he does so, because he has to follow Deianeira. In a piece of which the catastrophe was to turn on the poisoned robe, and which was to end with the death of Heracles, that hero himself ought to have been the principal object of interest throughout. The artistic unity of the tragedy demanded this. But the Heracles of Dorian legend, even when  treated as mortal, is still no typical human being; he is at once above and below the noblest type of man. If, therefore, Heracles was truly to dominate the scene, it was requisite that the pathos of this unique being should not have to compete with the deepest pathos of humanity. For, in such a competition, the purely human interest, if fully developed by a great master, could not but prove the stronger, as being, in its essence, more tragic. And therefore there was only one way to secure a paramount effectiveness for the Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> It was to place Deianeira more in the background; to make her also a less noble figure; to qualify her graces of character with some less attractive features; and, on the other hand, to bring out, in the amplest and most powerful manner, everything that is sublime and pathetic in the great hero's destiny.</p>
<p>In pointing out what seems to me the one serious defect of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, a remark should be added. It is easy to believe that, on the stage, the Heracles part would be far more effective than it is for readers. ‘As a representation of the extremity of a hero's suffering, this scene stands preeminent among all tragedies. Let Salvini act the hero, and its power would instantly be recognised.’ That was the opinion of an accomplished judge in such matters, the late Mr Fleeming Jenkin<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO"><title>Papers Literary, Scientific</title>, etc., by the late Fleeming Jenkin, F.R.S., LL. D., p. 23. (Longmans, 1887.)</bibl></note>; and I, for one, certainly should not dispute it. The intrinsic merits of the Heracles part are great; and a Salvini, or even an actor who was not quite a Salvini, could, no doubt, make the spectacle most impressive. But, even if he could make it absorbing—so that we should think only of what was passing before our eyes, and not at all of what had gone before in the play, the episode of Deianeira—that might be merely an instance of theatrical effect prevailing over the dramatic conscience. It would not necessarily prove that the tragedy, viewed as a work of art,—and therefore viewed as a whole,—was not really liable to the criticism suggested above. However effective the Heracles scene might be on the stage, I cannot help suspecting that an attentive spectator, in full sympathy with the spirit of the best Greek work, would be apt to  feel, <emph>at the end</emph>, that he had seen two tragedies; one, which closed with the death of Deianeira, and was of consummate excellence; then a second and shorter one, most pathetic, most powerful in its own way, but produced at a moral disadvantage. Yet, if this be indeed so, there is one consolation. A gain to the effect of the Heracles would have been dearly bought by any detriment to the unsurpassable beauty of the Deianeira.

<span class="line-ref">Line 13</span><p>Among the secondary parts, that of Hyllus has an im- <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Hyllus.</note> portance which might easily be undervalued. It is he who most vividly expresses the twofold aspect of Deianeira's action in sending the robe; the aspect which it wears for one who has seen only its dreadful result, without knowing its motive; and that which it assumes in the light of fuller knowledge. The first aspect is brought out when Hyllus describes the agonies of Heracles, and invokes a curse upon his mother; the second when, having learned her innocence and having stood beside her corpse, he has to listen to his father's denunciations of her—so like those which he himself was lately uttering—until a pause permits him to vindicate her memory. This frank, impulsive youth is warmly loyal to both parents; to the gentle and dearly loved mother, whom he mourns too late; and to the father, ‘the noblest man upon the earth,’ whose hard commands he obeys to the end, although those commands challenge a revolt of filial, even of natural, instincts,—seeming to him, indeed, almost like the promptings of Atè. Thus, under that dark shadow, pierced by no ray from above, which rests upon the close of the drama, this thrice-tried son calls the gods to witness that his own will has been overruled. With bitter anguish in his heart, he sees his father abandoned, as men must deem, by heaven; he is no longer the buoyant youth of the opening scene, but a man who must now take up the burden of a great inheritance, that Hyllus whom a grave and warlike race were to honour as the father of their kings, the ancestor of the Dorian Heracleidae.

Lichas is, before all things, the faithful henchman of Heracles; but, like every one else, he feels the charm of  Deianeira, and is feebly anxious to spare her feelings. His well-meant attempt is somewhat maladroit, since he has already been so communicative to her neighbours; but we remark the ingenuity of the poet, who has here utilised the varying traditions as to the motive of the war against Oechalia. Lichas exists only for his master; and there is a tragic fitness in his becoming the first victim of his master's fate. It would be a mistake to conceive his death as a poetical retribution for his duplicity; since, even if he had told the truth at first, Deianeira would still have sent the robe.

<p>The Messenger, with his interested zeal, afterwards dignified by his sturdy veracity, combines the traits of two similar persons in the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>,—the Corinthian messenger, and the Theban shepherd who confutes him.

With her death, their function is virtually at an end; after verse 970, they have only two utterances, both very brief (1044 f.; 1112 f.).</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 15</span><p>Among the difficulties of detail which the subject presented to a dramatist, not the least was that of the supposed ‘love-charm.’ The operation of the hydra's venom, like that of the poison in the wound of Philoctetes, is supernatural. Since, however, an innocent yet deliberate human agent intervenes between Nessus and Heracles, the poet was compelled to treat the incident with circumstance, and to invest it with just enough probability for the purpose of scenic effect. Sophocles has managed this by a simple but skilful device. He merely makes an assumption which no spectator would pause to examine. ‘The hydra's venom was such that <emph>exposure to heat</emph> must call it into activity.’ All is then easy. Nessus tells Deianeira that his gift, this infallible love-charm, must be kept in a cool and dark place. She tells us how scrupulously she  had observed this rule. She impresses it upon Lichas. The spectator knows that the robe is to be worn for the first time on an occasion of <emph>burnt sacrifice;</emph> and his anxiety is awakened.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare this episode with the parallel <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comparison with the <title>Medea.</title></note> one in the <title>Medea</title>, where Glaucè, Jason's new bride, is burnt to death by the magic agency of the robe and diadem which Medea, the injured wife, had given her. We see at once that Euripides had a far easier task than Sophocles. No third person, no innocent yet deliberate agent, intervenes between Medea and Glaucè. The gifts come to Glaucè directly from the hands of the mighty enchantress; and they had come to the enchantress from her grandsire, the Sun-god himself.</p>
<p>The garment of Heracles, like that of Glaucè, has naturally <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Supposed solar imagery.</note> been claimed for the wardrobe of the solar myth. It is the glow which enwraps the dawn or the sunset. Then Iolè is ‘the violet cloud’ who is to marry the rising sun (Hyllus), when his precursor (Heracles) has sunk to rest upon a flaming couch. The servitude to Omphalè is the apparent descent of the sun (Heracles) from the zenith to the horizon. Deianeira is the darkness which awaits him in the west. Thus to explain a story of varied human pathos, is at least to begin at the wrong end: it is to suppose myth-makers so intent on the sunrise and the sunset that men and women interested them primarily as symbols of those phenomena. Even the more limited theory, that Heracles was evolved from some older solar divinity, ill agrees with the central point of the fable,—promotion, painfully won, from earth to heaven. Later Greeks identified their Heracles, in certain aspects, with Melkarth, the sun-god of Tyre: some moderns have derived him from Izdubar, the solar hero of ancient Babylon<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">This view is sensibly rejected by  MeyerE. , <title>Geschichte des Alterthums</title> (Stuttgart, 1884), p. 185.</note>. In both cases the analogy is confined to details: the essence of the Greek myth remains distinct.

But they are not really so. Only two oracles are mentioned. (1) One was given to Heracles at Dodona, twelve years before the date at which the play begins, and said that, at the end of twelve years,  he should have ‘rest.’ The term of twelve years is mentioned in verses 824 f. (where see the note). (2) The other oracle, noticed only in vv. 1159 ff., was given to Heracles by Zeus himself, at some still earlier moment; but when, and where, we are not told. It concerned the <emph>manner</emph> of his death; saying that he was to be slain by a dead foe. These oracles have sometimes been regarded as if they formed the only bond which holds the plot together; and it has accordingly been objected to the plot that its unity is of a merely mechanical nature<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Wilamowitz, Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1. p. 384</bibl>: <quote lang="de">‘das drama nur kümmerlich durch orakelsprüche zu einer äusserlichen einheit zusammengehalten wird.’</quote></note>. The objection is ill-founded. The oracles have, indeed, a dramatic value, but it is of a different and a subordinate kind. At the outset of the play, the oracle concerning the twelve-years' term serves as a motive for anxiety; it announces that some crisis is imminent.

<span class="line-ref">Line 17</span><p>But the unity of the plot is independent of the oracles. It is effected by the love of Heracles for Iolè, which causes him to destroy Oechalia, and also causes Deianeira to send the robe; thus bringing the two episodes into a strict connection. Professor Campbell is, in my opinion, quite right when he says that ‘in point of dramatic structure the Trachiniae will bear comparison with the greatest of Sophoclean tragedies.’ For, even if, as I hold, the inferiority in dramatic interest of Heracles to Deianeira is such as to constitute a serious defect, this is not a defect of structure. It does not concern the manner in which the plot has been put together. It concerns something antecedent to the plot; namely, the conception of Heracles adopted by the poet, as compared with his conception of Deianeira. Given those two conceptions, the most perfect dramatic structure could not save the interest in Heracles from being overpowered by the interest in Deianeira.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Unity of time neglected.</note>There is, however, one point in which the texture of the plot is fairly open to criticism, though it is not a point of importance. The ‘unity of time’ has been disregarded with exceptional boldness. Hyllus goes to Euboea, witnesses the sacrifice there, and returns to Trachis, in a space of time measured by less than  700 lines (vv. 93—734). Nay, Lichas, who leaves Trachis at verse 632, had reached Euboea before the sacrifice began. Many other examples show the habitual laxity of Greek dramatists, and the tolerance of Greek audiences, in this particular. But in the <title>Trachiniae</title> the license has a special excuse. Amid the excitement, the alternations of hope and fear, which pervade this play, the action hastens forward in a manner which leaves us no leisure to remark the feats of travelling performed by Hyllus and by Lichas. This is the case even with readers; much more would it be so with spectators. And here we may observe the subtlety of the poet, who has introduced two direct allusions to the passage of time. Lichas, about to start for Euboea, remarks that he has already stayed too long (v. 599); and the Chorus prays that the ship which is bringing Heracles ‘may not tarry’ (v. 655). This is like the art of a diplomatist who diverts suspicion by apparent frankness.

<span class="line-ref">Line 18</span><p>After the two dramas of the Attic masters, Heracles <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Seneca's <title>Hercules Oetaeus.</title></note> appears only once in the extant literature of ancient Tragedy. Seneca founded his <title>Hercules Furens</title> on the play of Euripides, and his <title>Hercules Oetaeus</title> on the play of Sophocles. It would be profitless to institute a detailed comparison between the <title>Trachiniae</title> and a work which Seneca, in the fashion of his day, composed rather as a rhetorical exercise than as a piece for the stage. Those who read it, with the Greek model present to their minds, can only wonder how the Roman's brilliant gifts of expression, —which shine in epigram and, at moments, reach a true elevation of sentiment,—could co-exist with such abject tastelessness, such extravagance of bombast, such insensibility to proportion. Yet, in one respect, a comparison is very interesting. If the Phaedra of the <title>Hippolytus</title> has fared ill at Seneca's hands, far worse is the transformation which he has effected in the Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The following lines describe <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Latin Deianeira</note> Deianeira's behaviour when Iolè first arrives at Trachis:—

Her. O. 255" valid="yes"><title>Herc. Oet.</title> 255 ff.</bibl></note>; and finally avows her own readiness to kill him<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Sen. Her. O. 436" valid="yes">Ib. 436.</bibl></note>. Certainly Seneca has protected our sympathy with the hero from competition; but the hero himself, bragging and whining by turns, fails to profit by that advantage. The <title>Hercules Oetaeus</title> became the model of Rotrou, in his tragedy entitled <title>Hercule Mourant</title><note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Published in 1632. Rotrou gave Heracles a successful rival in the affections of Iolè, a certain Arcas. The dying hero forbade Iolè to marry Arcas; but, after his apotheosis, he showed his magnanimity by descending from Olympus on purpose to revoke the veto.</note>; and also influenced, in a greater or less degree, several other French dramas on the same theme<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">M. Patin, <title>Etudes sur les trag. grecs</title>, vol. II. p. 89.</bibl></note>. It was inevitable that the Latin writer, rather than Sophocles, should be imitated by a French dramatist of the seventeenth century. Apart from this, however, the Deianeira of Seneca, considered as a general type, would be more truly congenial to the French stage. It was difficult for the Latin races to imagine a woman, supplanted in her husband's love, who did not wish to kill somebody,—her rival, or her husband, or both. Ovid's Deianeira is by no means so bad as Seneca's; but she, too, has the impulse to destroy Iolè<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Met. 9.151" valid="yes">Ovid <title>Met.</title> 9. 151.</bibl></note>. The Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, with anguish in her soul,—intent on regaining her lord's heart, but not angry, not malevolent towards him or towards Iolè,—this Deianeira is a creation of the Hellenic spirit, refined by the sweetness, the purity, the restrained strength of Athens at her best; if any one would see the spiritual kinswomen of this Deianeira, he must look for them on the grave-reliefs of the Cerameicus.</p>

But, in relation to the legends of Heracles, Attic Tragedy, represented by the <title>Mad Heracles</title> and the <title>Trachiniae</title>, had no direct influence upon art, such as can be traced, for instance, in regard to Philoctetes. For the story of Heracles, artists drew upon other, generally older, sources of poetry or tradition. When, indeed, in Hellenistic and Roman times a degenerate Heracles became the type of a strong man easily enthralled by pleasure, a companion of the Bacchic thiasos or of the Erôtes<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Furtwängler, <emph>ap.</emph> Roscher, p. 2248.</note>, then the art which desired to portray him often went for material to the theatre; but such material was furnished by the Heracles of Comedy or of satyr-drama. It is not surprising, then, that the illustrations of the <title>Trachiniae</title> which Greek art affords are only of a general kind. For example, each of the three successive forms assumed by the Acheloüs of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, when he was a suitor for Deianeira, can be separately identified in works of art<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See commentary on v. 11.</note>. But, though the fight of Heracles with Acheloüs was a subject often treated by artists, no extant representation of that combat corresponds precisely with the scene as described by Sophocles<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The nearest approach to an illustration of the poet's text is given by an archaic gem, now in the British Museum, first published (roughly) in King's <title>Ancient Gems</title>, II. pl. 34, fig. 3. Mr   Murray S. has kindly given me an impression of it. Yet even this diverges from Sophocles in three particulars. (1) On the gem, Acheloüs is the man-headed bull,—a frequent type, but not one of those specified by the poet. (2) Deianeira stands lamenting, close to the combatants; whereas the poet describes her as sitting by a hill at some distance from the fray. (3) There is no trace of Aphroditè, whom Sophocles mentions as present with the combatants in the quality of umpire.</note>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 20</span><p>We have now considered the nature of the legendary <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Diction.</note> material used in the <title>Trachiniae;</title> the character of the treatment  applied to it by the poet; and the principal features of the tragedy viewed as a work of dramatic art. An introduction to this play must also, however, take account of its style in a more limited sense,—the style of its poetical diction, the complexion of the language. For the details of this subject, reference must necessarily be made to the commentary on the text. But a few general observations may properly be offered here.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Successive phases in the style of Sophocles.</note>It is a well-attested tradition, and one which can still be partially verified, that the style of Sophocles, like that of many other great poets, was developed through successive phases, belonging to successive periods of his life. He himself, according to Plutarch<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">  <title>Mor.</title>p. 79  B. (<quote lang="greek">Πῶς ἄν τις αἴσθοιτο ἑαυτοῦ προκόπτοντος ἐπ’ ἀρετῇ</quote>, c. 7.) <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ γὰρ ὁ Σοφοκλῆς ἔλεγε τὸν Αἰσχύλου διαπεπαιχὼς ὄγκον, ε&lt;*&gt;τα τὸ πικρὸν καὶ κατάτεχνον τῆς αὑτοῦ κατασκευῆς, τρίτον ἤδη τὸ τῆς λέξεως μεταβάλλειν ε&lt;*&gt;δος ὅπερ ἐστὶν ἠθικώτατον καὶ βέλτιστον, οὕτως οἱ φιλοσοφοῦντες, ὅταν ἐκ τῶν πανηγυρικῶν καὶ κατατέχνων εἰς τὸν ἁπτόμενον ἤθους καὶ πάθους λόγον καταβῶσιν, ἄρχονται τὴν ἀληθῆ προκοπὴν καὶ ἄτυφον προκόπτειν</quote>.</note>, distinguished three such phases. In the earliest, he had imitated the majesty, the pomp,—<quote lang="greek">ὄγκος</quote>,—of Aeschylus. Next came the style which, in Plutarch's notice, is described by the words, <quote lang="greek">τὸ πικρὸν καὶ κατάτεχνον τῆς αὑτοῦ κατασκευῆς</quote>. This was a style marked by subtle elaboration, and, as a result of it, by <quote lang="greek">τὸ πικρόν</quote>, ‘pungency,’ ‘incisiveness’; a style in which terse and polished force of expression drove home the ‘sting’ of word or phrase;—as Eupolis,—to borrow an illustration from a different, yet cognate, province,—said that the incisive and highly wrought oratory of Pericles left its ‘sting’ in the minds of those who heard him: <quote lang="greek">τὸ κέντρον ἐγκατέλιπε τοῖς ἀκροωμένοις</quote>. Such a style, with its affinities to an elevated and refined rhetoric, can be a source of great brilliancy and power in poetry; but its essential quality is not that which constitutes the highest excellence of drama: its defect, for the purposes of drama, is that it is too suggestive of conscious effort in the artist; its tendency is to image <emph>his</emph> mind somewhat too strongly in the persons whom he wishes to make live upon the scene. Hence we readily comprehend the words in which Sophocles (according to Plutarch) defined the third, the final, phase of his style;—<quote lang="greek">τὸ τῆς λέξεως εἶδος ὅπερ ἐστὶν ἠθικώτατον καὶ βέλτιστον</quote>: ‘the kind of diction  which is most expressive of character, and best’; that is, fittest to make each person of the drama seem a real human being; and best, therefore, for the purposes of a dramatist.</p>
<p>The first of these three phases, the Aeschylean, is not traceable in the extant work of Sophocles. Nor can it be said that any one of the seven tragedies represents the second style in a form which sharply distinguishes it from the third; that is, in a form from which the characteristic quality of the third style is absent. But, if the <title>Philoctetes</title>, one of the very latest plays (409 B.C.), be taken as a standard of comparison, there, at least, is seen the perfection of the third style, the style which is ‘expressive of character’; while there is less of visible and masterful art in language, less of <quote lang="greek">τὸ πικρὸν καὶ κατάτεχνον</quote>, than appears, for example, in the <title>Antigone.</title>

<span class="line-ref">Line 21</span><p>Nowhere is the poet's ethical portraiture more delicately <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Distinctive traits in the diction of the <title>Trachiniae.</title></note> vivid than in the heroine of the <title>Trachiniae;</title> and a sympathetic reader will feel that the language given to her might well be called <quote lang="greek">ἠθικωτάτη λέξις</quote>. It is exquisitely moulded to the expression of her nature. Take, again, the scene where the Messenger, in Deianeira's presence, taxes Lichas with deceit (vv. 393—435). The shades of language most skilfully characterise the three persons,—the gentle but resolute lady; the herald, nervously deferential to her, but angrily assertive of his dignity against his humble cross-examiner, the Messenger; and lastly the Messenger himself, with his traits of blunt or familiar speech<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">One of these traits is notable,—the <quote lang="greek">ποίαν δόκησιν</quote>; (427). This use of <quote lang="greek">ποῖος</quote>, a common colloquialism, occurs in only one other passage of Tragedy, and that is in a late play of Euripides (<title>Helen.</title> 566; 412 B.C.).</note>. In this aspect, then, the <title>Trachiniae</title> shows, like the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the full excellence of the third style,—that which is <quote lang="greek">ἠθικώτατον</quote>, ‘most expressive of character.’</p>
<p>But the <title>Trachiniae</title> combines this ethical charm of style with a highly elaborate manner in a certain class of passages. Every Greek tragedy contains at least one set speech, <quote lang="greek">ῥῆσις</quote>, of the type usually spoken by a messenger who relates a catastrophe. In such speeches, which were really short excursions of drama into the region of epos, the dramatist was convention ally free to use any measure of rhetorical elaboration, however unsuitable it might be to the person of the speaker; some of the most elaborate <quote lang="greek">ῥήσεις</quote> are delivered by servants. Now, it is a peculiarity of the <title>Trachiniae</title> that, beside two speeches which are normal examples of this class,—the speech of Hyllus (vv. 749—812), and that of the Nurse (vv. 899—946),—it contains a remarkable number of other passages which are closely akin to that class. Such are the following short narratives;—Lichas recounts the recent deeds of his master (248—290); Deianeira relates her meeting with Nessus (531—587); and describes the occurrence which rouses her fears concerning the ‘love-charm’ (672—722): such, also, is the great speech of Heracles (1046— 1111). Altogether, about one fourth of the play consists of passages which invited or demanded this high elaboration of style, usually reserved for very exceptional moments. It is no accident that the element of narrative in the <title>Trachiniae</title> is so abnormally large; the cause lies in the nature of the fable itself, and is independent of the circumstance that an epic poem, the <title>Capture of Oechalia</title>, was probably one of the chief sources. In narrative or description Sophocles exhibits, as a rule, two characteristics; he is remarkably terse; and he has a bold but artistic originality of phrase, often in a manner which resembles that of Vergil. If the passages just cited from the <title>Trachiniae</title> are compared with their only proper analogues, the set <quote lang="greek">ῥήσεις</quote> of the poet's other plays, it will be felt that, with allowance for differences of degree, the essential quality of style is the same; the greater frequency of it is the distinction of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> This play, like the <title>Philoctetes</title>, is mainly an example of that Sophoclean manner which tradition calls the third or ripest,—the manner ‘best fitted to express character.’ But, owing to special causes, it also gives striking prominence to the dominant trait of the poet's ‘second’ manner, elaborate and incisive force of phrase,—<quote lang="greek">τὸ πικρὸν καὶ κατάτεχνον</quote>. This is a peculiar combination of elements; and it tends to make a reader feel that the style of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is somehow, as a whole, unlike the style found in any one of the other six plays. From that feeling, it has been an easy, but hasty, step to the inference that the manner of this play is unworthy of the master; that it  shows the immaturity of youth, or the feebleness of age; or even that it is altogether foreign to him, and must have proceeded from some inferior hand<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See above, § 1, notes 1, 2, 3.</note>.

For, in the first place, Deianeira's speech is no soliloquy,—though it is true that she is rather communing with her own thoughts than directly addressing the Nurse; it gives the cue for the Nurse's suggestion that Hyllus should be sent to seek his father, and thus serves to set the drama in motion. Secondly, it is dramatic as illustrating the mind of Deianeira herself,—that mind which is to govern the subsequent action<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Schlegel's criticism (§ 1, n. 3) was the inspiration of a short ‘programm’ published at Cleve (Prussia) in 1830 by C.  M. AxtA. , <title>Commentatio critica qua Trachiniarum Sophocleae prologum subdititium esse demonstratur.</title> Axt uses the term ‘prologue,’ not in the Greek sense (i.e. to denote vv. 1—93), but only with reference to Deianeira's speech, vv. 1—48. He holds that the play ought to begin at v. 49, with the speech of the <quote lang="greek">τροφός</quote>.</note>. Even with regard to this prologue, the inner contrast between the two poets is more significant than the resemblance. Nor can it be said that the general style of the play shows any pervading influence of the supposed kind.

He was well acquainted with the works of Euripides, and admired them; in his later years, they influenced him in details of language and of versification. But the style of Sophocles, so far as extant work shows, always preserved a thoroughly distinctive character. Certainly the <title>Trachiniae</title> is no exception to that rule; and not merely the style, but the whole mind which appears there, attests the authorship.</p></div2></div><span class="line">

The gen. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πατρὸς</lemma>, placed at the beginning of the clause, illustrates the normal Greek tendency to announce the subject of the statement at the outset (as in <quote lang="greek">τοῦτον οἶσθ’ εἰ ζῶν κυρεῖ</quote>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 444" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>444</bibl> n.). The second gen., <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῦ … δοκεῖν</lemma>, is ‘epexegetic,’ as defining the <quote lang="greek">ὤραν</quote>. But it is not in apposition with <quote lang="greek">πατρός</quote> (‘care for his father,—<emph>that is</emph>, care for his being deemed,’ etc.). Rather the two genitives are linked to <quote lang="greek">ὤραν</quote> with slightly different shades of meaning;— ‘care, on his father's account, for his being deemed.’ Instead of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῦ … δοκεῖν</lemma>, we might have had a relative clause, <quote lang="greek">ὅπως ἂν...δοκῇ</quote>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 85</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἡνίκ’ ἢ σεσώσμεθα … οἰχόμεσθ’ ἅμα</lemma>. Verses 83 and 85 are probably right as they stand, while v. 84 is spurious. The original form of the interpolation was, however, I think, <quote lang="greek">καὶ πίπτομεν σοῦ πατρὸς ἐξολωλότος</quote>, intended to <emph>follow</emph> <quote lang="greek">οἰχόμεσθ’ ἅμα</quote>, in order to supply the condition opposed to <quote lang="greek">κείνου βίον σώσαντος</quote>. Then it struck a reviser that the passage would be more forcible if <quote lang="greek">καὶ πίπτομεν</quote> were changed to <quote lang="greek">ἢ πίπτομεν</quote>, and v. 85 were omitted.</p>
<p>This view of the original text may be supported by a consideration which does not seem to have been noticed. The very circumstance which prompted the interpolation—viz., the absence of the <emph>condition</emph> for <quote lang="greek">οἰχόμεσθ’ ἅμα</quote>—is an admirable dramatic touch. For, while Deianeira and her hearers would understand <quote lang="greek">ἅμα</quote> as meaning, <quote lang="greek">ἅμα οἰχομένῳ</quote>, her death is really to be linked with his victory.</p>
<p>For a similar piece of textual history, cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Andr. 6" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Andr.</title>6</bibl>, where the true text is <quote lang="greek">νῦν δ), εἴτις ἄλλη, δυστυχεστάτη γυνή</quote>: but there was another reading, which made two verses of it:—<quote lang="greek">νῦν δ’ οὔτις</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">νῦν δὴ τίς</quote>) <quote lang="greek">ἄλλη δυστυχεστέρα γυνὴ</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ἐμοῦ πέφυκεν ἢ γενήσεταί ποτε</quote>. Of the second v., the schol. there says, <quote lang="greek">οἱ ὑποκριταὶ τὸν ἴαμβον προσέθηκαν</quote>. See Appendix.</p>
<p>The synizesis in <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ οἰχόμεσθ)</lemma> cannot be strictly paralleled: but cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 535" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>535</bibl><quote lang="greek">τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι</quote>. I had thought of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ κείμεσθ)</lemma>, which derives some support from the fact that <quote lang="greek">ἢ κ</quote> (<emph>sic</emph>) <quote lang="greek">οἰχόμεσθ)</quote> occurs as a variant (cr. n.): but <quote lang="greek">οἰχόμεσθ)</quote> is better, and is probably sound.

C.</title>265</bibl> n. ‘Even to one who is late, good fortune, if he should ever hear of it, brings gain.’ The general sentiment, ‘better late than never,’ is adapted to the particular case. Hyllus is going in search of tidings; and even now, if he hears good tidings, he will have his reward. The words <quote lang="greek">ἐπεὶ <emph>πύθοιτο</emph></quote> make it clear (I think) that <quote lang="greek">τὸ εὖ πράσσειν</quote> has here its ordinary sense, ‘faring well,’—not the much rarer sense, ‘acting aright’ (like <quote lang="greek">πράσσοντα καλῶς</quote>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1764" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>1764</bibl> n.). The optat. gives abstract generality, which suits a <quote lang="greek">γνώμη</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐμπολᾷ</lemma>. Any profitable action may be said, by a metaphor from trading, to ‘bring in’ gain.

The inverted order of the words (‘chiasmus’) has its usual effect for the ear,—viz., to indi cate that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φλογιζόμενον</lemma> balances <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐναριζομένα</lemma>, as <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατευνάζει</lemma> balances <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τίκτει</lemma>. And this is so, if <quote lang="greek">ἐναριζο&lt;*&gt;ένα</quote> implies, not only ‘slain,’ but ‘despoiled,’—thus serving, with  <quote lang="greek">αἰόλα</quote>, to suggest that bright panoply which Night is still wearing when the Dawn comes to vanquish her,—ere the Sun-god has yet issued from her womb. Cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 279" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title>279</bibl><quote lang="greek">τῆς νῦν τεκούσης φῶς τόδ’ εὐφρόνης</quote>.</p>
<p>The text has been much suspected (see cr. n.), but without reason. The imagery, indeed, does not form a consistent whole: Night is slain, and then overcomes. But this is merely one of many instances in which the poet's language wavers between the figurative and the literal.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατευνάζει τε φλογιζόμενον</lemma>. The passage is marred by placing the comma, as some do, after <quote lang="greek">τε</quote>, and taking the partic. with <quote lang="greek">αἰτῶ</quote>. Cp. Byron, <title>Corsair</title>, canto III.: ‘Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run, | Along Morea's hills the setting sun; | Not, as in northern climes, obscurely bright, | But one unclouded blaze of living light.’

<span class="line-ref">Line 100</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ ποντίας … κλιθείς</lemma>. The general sense is simply, ‘where is he on sea or land?’ <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ποντίας</lemma>, rather than <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ποντίους</lemma> (see cr. n.), is probably right. According to Athenaeus (p. 189 D), <quote lang="greek">αὐλών</quote> is masc. in Attic prose, but fem. in poetry: he quotes  Soph. (fr. 503) <quote lang="greek">ἐπακτίας αὐλῶνας</quote>, and Carcînus (fr. 1) <quote lang="greek">βαθεῖαν εἰς αὐλῶνα</quote>. Although, then, <quote lang="greek">πόντιος</quote> could be used as an adj. of two terminations,  Soph. may have preferred the distinctively fem. form here. In   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. PB 731" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>P. V.</title>731</bibl>, however, the word  is masc., <quote lang="greek">αὐλῶν’ ἐκπερᾶν Μαιωτικόν</quote> (of the Cimmerian Bosporus).</p>

For a similar difference in form between the clauses after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ</lemma>
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἤ</lemma>, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc.  4. 5" valid="yes">Thuc.4. 5</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐν ὀλιγωρίᾳ ἐποιοῦντο</quote> (<quote lang="greek">τοὺς Ἀθηναίους</quote>), <quote lang="greek">ὡς...ἢ οὐχ ὑπομενοῦντας σφᾶς, ἢ ῥᾳδίως ληψόμενοι βίᾳ</quote>: where the acc. <quote lang="greek">ὑπομενοῦντας</quote> (governing <quote lang="greek">σφᾶς</quote>) is better taken as depending on the verb than as absol.

The phrase was suggested by the epic use of <quote lang="greek">κέκλιμαι</quote>, as said (<emph>a</emph>) of land which <emph>slopes down</emph> to the water's edge,—thus, as it were, ‘resting on’ the water;  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<p>This use of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δισσαῖσιν</lemma> is possible only because <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόθι</lemma> precedes. We could not say (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>), <quote lang="greek">δισσαῖς ἠπείροις οἰκεῖ</quote>, meaning ‘he dwells in one of the two continents.’ But it is correct to say, <quote lang="greek">ποῦ δισσαῖς ἠπείροις οἰκεῖ</quote><emph>;</emph> meaning, ‘where in (either of) the two continents is his home?’</p>
<p>‘The two continents’ (Europe and Asia, Africa being included in the latter) mean, ‘the habitable world.’ <bibl default="NO" n="Isoc. 4.179" valid="yes">Isocr. or. 4 § 179</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τῆς γὰρ γῆς ἁπάσης τῆς ὑπὸ τῷ κόσμῳ κειμένης δίχα τετμημένης, καὶ τῆς μὲν Ἀσίας τῆς δ’ Εὐρώπης καλουμένης</quote>. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Var.

Jug. 17" valid="yes"><title>Jug.</title> 17.</bibl>）</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ποντίας αὐλῶνας</lemma> is merely a general expression for the sea. The phrase was suggested by the Aegaean, with its <cit><quote lang="la">interfusa nitentes | … aequora Cycladas</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Hor. Carm. 1.14.19" valid="yes">(Hor. <title>C.</title> 1. 14. 19)</bibl></cit>. Paley understands:—‘Is he near home, in the Euripus (<quote lang="greek">αὐλῶνας</quote>), or midway between both continents, <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, in the Hellespont?’ Mr Whitelaw, too, thinks that the Hellespont is meant, and that <quote lang="greek">δισς. ἀπείροις</quote>=‘on a slope looking towards both continents,’—the sea being regarded as an eminence.

(2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐν</lemma> is to be inserted, but <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴδοι</lemma> changed to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴδῃ</lemma>, an epic subjunct. of comparison, as in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

(3) The objection to Zippmann's compromise—<quote lang="greek">κύματ’ <emph>ἐν</emph>...βάντ) ἐπιόντ) <emph>ἂν</emph></quote>—is the harsh asyndeton, which is foreign to the poet's manner.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βάντ’ ἐπιόντα τ)</lemma>, lit., ‘having passed by, and coming on.’ The spectator sees wave after wave go by.—Others understand, ‘driven <emph>back</emph>, and then coming on again’ (Blaydes, ‘ebbing and flowing’). This gives a forced sense to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βάντ)</lemma>.

The pron. refers back to vv. 103—111, which spoke of Deianeira's laments. There is no real obscurity in this, since her grief is the main theme of the ode, and the second strophe (112— 121) referred to the fate of Heracles as the cause of that grief.</p>
<p>Hense (whom Nauck follows) thinks that this second antistrophe (122—131) requires to be transposed, so as to become the second strophe, immediately following v. 111. But this change is worse than unnecessary. It is liable to the fatal objection that vv. 132 ff. (<quote lang="greek">μένει γὰρ</quote> etc.) are then severed from the thought which they develope (vv. 129—131 <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ πῆμα καὶ χαρὰ</quote> etc.). They are brought into a context which does not suit them (vv. 119— 121 <quote lang="greek">ἀλλά τις θεῶν</quote> etc.).

The sing. oft. has this meaning (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῷδ)</lemma> is opposed to the <quote lang="greek">τῷ μὲν</quote> implied in the preceding clause. It is true that the main point is the changing experience of the individual, rather than the transference of joy or woe to his neighbour.

<p>Other views are as follows.

(2) <quote lang="greek">τῷ δ)</quote>=simply ‘<emph>and to him</emph>,’—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, to the person from whom woe or joy ‘has gone.’ But: (<emph>a</emph>) <quote lang="greek">τῷ δ)</quote> surely implies an antithesis. (<emph>b</emph>) The clause <quote lang="greek">τῷ δ’ ἐπέρχεται κ.τ.λ.</quote> would thus mean merely,—‘and then his experiences begin over again.’

<span class="line-ref">Line 169</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοιαῦτ’ ἔφραζε … πόνων</lemma>. Among the various explanations of the gen. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶν Ἡρακλείων πόνων</lemma>, two seem better than the rest; and I prefer that which I place first.</p>
<p>(1) It is a gen. of connection, equiv. to the gen. with <quote lang="greek">περί</quote>, and going with the whole phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἱμαρμένα ἐκτελευτᾶσθαι</lemma> rather than with either word alone. ‘He said that such things were destined to be  accomplished <emph>in regard to</emph> the toils of Heracles.’ This is only a rarer and bolder form of the gen. used in poetry after verbs of ‘speaking <emph>about</emph>’ ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 317" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>317</bibl><quote lang="greek">τοῦ κασιγνήτου τί φής</quote><emph>;</emph>), ‘asking about’ ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 439" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>439</bibl><quote lang="greek">φωτὸς ἐξερήσομαι</quote>), ‘hearing about’ ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 307" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>307</bibl><quote lang="greek">κλύων σοῦ</quote>). And there is another passage of Sophocles which shows a similarly bold use of it, viz.,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 355" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>355</bibl>（<quote lang="greek">μαντεῖα</quote>) <quote lang="greek">ἃ τοῦδ’ ἐχρήσθη σώματος</quote>, ‘the oracles that had been given <emph>concerning</emph> me’: an example which (to my mind) strongly confirms this view.</p>
<p>(2) It is also possible, though less probable, that the gen. should be taken as partitive with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκτελευτᾶσθαι</lemma>: destined to be accomplished as part of (in the number of) his toils. For this we might compare such uses of the partitive gen. as <quote lang="greek">πλεῖν τοῦ πρώτου στόλου</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 73" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>73</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">ἐξετάζεσθαι τῶν συγχαιρόντων</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 21.202" valid="yes">Dem. or. 21 § 202</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">ἀριθμεῖσθαι τῶν μακάρων</quote>, etc.</p>
<p>(3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόνων</lemma> depends on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πρὸς θεῶν εἱμαρμένα</lemma> as if it were a subst. <quote lang="greek">εἱμαρμένην</quote>:— ‘he said that such <emph>a doom for the toils of H.</emph> was to be fulfilled.’</p>
<p>(4) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόνων</lemma> depends on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκτελευτᾶσθαι</lemma> as equiv. to <quote lang="greek">τελευτὴν γίγνεσθαι</quote>: ‘he said that such events were <emph>to be accomplished as the end of</emph> his toils.’ I do not think that the Greek words will bear either of the two latter versions.

The signs were taken from the movement and rustling of the oak's leaves; and these signs were interpreted by the priestesses called <quote lang="greek">Πελειάδες</quote>. Cp. fr. 414 <quote lang="greek">τὰς θεσπιῳδοὺς ἱερίας Δωδωνίδας</quote>. Euripides spoke of three such priestesses; but Pindar, like Sophocles, gave the number as two (schol. here). In saying that the oak ‘<emph>spake</emph>’ (<quote lang="greek">αὐδῆσαι</quote>) by their mouths, he follows the established mode of expression with regard to it. See, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, Lucian <title>Amor.</title> 31 <quote lang="greek">ἡ ἐν Δωδώνῃ φηγὸς...ἱερὰν ἀπορρήξασα φωνήν</quote>. Constantine Porphyr. 2. 55 <quote lang="greek">Δωδώνη, ἐφ’ ἧς ἡ δρῦς ἡ φθεγγομένη τὰ τῶν δαιμόνων μυστήρια</quote>.</p>
<p>Others understand:—(1) ‘by the agency of two doves’: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the signs from the oak were somehow combined with, or explained by, signs derived from birds. (2) ‘The oak spake from between two doves’; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> a symbolical dove, of stone or metal, stood on either side of the tree. The Appendix will show what can be said for or against each of these theories. Here  it may be noted that neither seems to accord so well with the phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐδῆσαι ἐκ</lemma>.

Trach. 1174" valid="yes">cp. 1174</bibl>; and with dat., 1164). Thus the sense is:—‘The precise term foretold by these prophecies tallies [with the period which has actually elapsed] at the present time,’ <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὡς</lemma> (=<quote lang="greek">ὥστε</quote>) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τελεσθῆναι χρεών</lemma>, ‘so that they must be fulfilled.’ (With <quote lang="greek">χρεών</quote> we may understand either <quote lang="greek">ἐστί</quote> or <quote lang="greek">εἶναι</quote>: the former is simpler: for the ellipse, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

In other words, ‘This is precisely the time when the fulfilment of these predictions falls due.’ The schol. saw that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὡς</lemma> is for <quote lang="greek">ὥστε</quote> (<quote lang="greek">ὥστε ὁπότερον πραχθῆναι</quote>). The change to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ᾧ</lemma> is needless, and worse.</p>
<p>Others understand:—(1) ‘The true fulfilment of these words <emph>as</emph> (<quote lang="greek">ὡς</quote>) they are to be accomplished’; or (2) ‘the truth of the prediction <emph>that</emph> (<quote lang="greek">ὡς</quote>) these things are to be accomplished.’</p>
<p>This is one of those passages in which the manner of Sophocles recalls that of Vergil. The general meaning is simple and clear&lt;*&gt; but a verbal analysis demands the nicest care.

A discussion of other views will be found in the Appendix. Here I note these points.</p>
<p>(1) If <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ … ποθοῦν</lemma> is sound, it means, ‘<emph>the feeling of desire</emph>’ in the questioner's mind. It cannot mean ‘his desire’ in the sense of ‘that which <emph>is desired</emph> by him’ (<quote lang="greek">τὸ ποθούμενον</quote> schol.). This, at least, is the inference from all the evidence available: see nn. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 267" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>267</bibl><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1604." valid="yes"> O. C., 1604.</bibl></p>
<p>(2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ ποθοῦν ἐκμαθεῖν</lemma> cannot mean, then, ‘to learn what is desired.’ <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκμαθεῖν</lemma>, if it is to govern <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ ποθοῦν</lemma>, must be explained as having a pregnant sense, <quote lang="greek">ἐκπλῆσαι μαθών</quote>, ‘to <emph>satisfy</emph> the desire <emph>by learning.</emph>’ Some analogies might be quoted ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 399" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>399</bibl>): but the phrase seems impossibly harsh.</p>
<p>(3) It remains, then, to take <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ ποθοῦν</lemma> as an acc. of reference: ‘<emph>with regard to</emph> his curiosity, wishing to be fully informed.’ This is awkward; but it is not inconceivable.

<p> This lively ‘dance-song’ (<quote lang="greek">ὑπόρχημα</quote>) is the direct response of the Chorus to Deianeira's appeal (202 <quote lang="greek">φωνήσατ)</quote>),—expressing their delight at the good news. As Dr. W. Christ, who calls it ‘a paean to Artemis and Apollo,’ justly remarks (<title>Metrik</title> § 443), its contents clearly point to a distribution of the verses between different singers. (1) The first part, down to v. 215 (<quote lang="greek">Νύμφας</quote>), is an invitation to song and dance; this would be given either by the coryphaeus, or by the leader of one semichorus. (2) The second part, vv. 216—220 (<quote lang="greek">ἀείρομ)...ἅμιλλαν</quote>), is the response, delivered by the leader of the other semichorus. (3) Then, at v. 221, the whole Chorus joins in with the refrain of the paean, <quote lang="greek">ἰὼ ἰὼ Παιάν</quote>.  (4) The coryphaeus then gives the last three verses, which introduce the next scene.—For the metres, see Metrical Analysis.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀνολολυξάτω</lemma> has been recognised by almost all recent critics and metrists as a certain correction of <quote lang="greek">ἀνολολύξετε</quote> (L) or <quote lang="greek">‐ατε</quote>. But I should keep the MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμοις</lemma>, merely reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἁ</lemma> for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁ</lemma> with Erfurdt. The clue to a right interpretation here depends on two points in the context. (1) Deianeira has called for a joyous cry from the women <emph>in the house</emph>, and from those <emph>outside of it</emph> (203 f.). The first words of the Chorus accordingly appeal to the women <emph>in the house</emph>,—as is marked, not only by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμοις</lemma>, but by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐφεστίοις</lemma>, adding that the <emph>men</emph> of the household are to join in. Then, at v. 210, <quote lang="greek">ὁμοῦ δὲ...παιᾶν)...ὦ παρθένοι</quote>, the maidens <emph>of the Chorus</emph> are invited to raise the paean. (2) The words <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐν δὲ κοινὸς ἀρσένων</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign> could not have been used unless a reference to <emph>women</emph> had <emph>preceded;</emph> it is not enough that it should <emph>follow</emph>, in <quote lang="greek">ὦ παρθένοι</quote>, at v. 210.</p>
<p>Hence we have to choose between these views, of which I prefer the first. (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἁ μελλόνυμφος</lemma>, ‘she whose nuptials are soon to come,’ is a poetical phrase for <emph>virgo nubilis</emph>, and denotes the maidens of the household generally. Nauck, reading <quote lang="greek">δόμοις...<emph>ὁ</emph> μελλόνυμφος</quote>, gives this sense to it, but admits that the masc. (‘<emph>quisquis</emph> nubilis est’) is awkward: rather it is impossible. (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἁ μελλόνυμφος</lemma>=‘she who is soon to be (re-)united to a husband,’ <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> Deianeira. This is a forcing of the Greek word which can easily be smoothed over in an English paraphrase, but which would probably have seemed very strange to a Greek. (3) Reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμος … ὁ μελλόνυμφος</lemma>, ‘the household of maidens,’ <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> ‘the maidens of the household.’ This seems an untenable usage: moreover the metre condemns <quote lang="greek">δόμος</quote>.—Another version of this reading, ‘the house which is soon to receive the husband,’ not only strains <quote lang="greek">μελλόνυμφος</quote>, but fails to supply the necessary antithesis to <quote lang="greek">ἀρσένων</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀνολολυξάτω</lemma>: the <quote lang="greek">ὀλολυγή</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ὀλολυγμός</quote> was a cry to the gods, usually expressive of joy or hope, in prayer or sacrifice: and it is especially said of women (<emph>e.g. </emph> <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 6.301" valid="yes"> Il.6. 301</bibl>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 3.450" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title>3. 450</bibl>:   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Seven 268" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Theb.</title>268</bibl> etc.). But this verb denotes a cry of horror in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 750." valid="yes">Soph. <title>El.</title>750.</bibl></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμοις</lemma>, rather ‘<emph>for</emph> the house’ (dat. of interest) than merely ‘in it’; cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 27" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title>27</bibl><quote lang="greek">δόμοις</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ὀλολυγμὸν εὐφημοῦντα τῇδε λαμπάδι</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ἐπορθιάζειν.—<emph>ἀλαλαγαῖς</emph></quote>, probably due to Triclinius, has been received instead of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλαλαῖς</lemma> by many recent edd., in order that the first foot of the verse may be a tribrach (see  Analysis Metr.). <quote lang="greek">ἀλαλή</quote> was the more frequent form; but the other occurs as a <emph>v. l.</emph> in   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Phoen. 335" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Phoen.</title>335</bibl>, as <quote lang="greek">ἀλαλαλαί</quote> is a <emph>v. l.</emph> for <quote lang="greek">ἀλαλαί</quote> in   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Birds 1761" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Av.</title>1761</bibl>: and a loss of <quote lang="greek">αλ</quote> or <quote lang="greek">αγ</quote> would of course have been easy. The <quote lang="greek">ἀλαλή</quote> was a cry of triumph ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 133" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ant.</title>133</bibl> n.).

Rh. 1. 419</bibl>; Ephesus, <bibl default="NO" n="Strab. 14.639" valid="yes">Strabo 14. 639</bibl>); but most frequently with Delos, as a name either for that island itself, or for some islet near it (Rheneia?): cp. <bibl default="NO" n="HH 16" valid="yes"><title>Hom. h.

<p>Artemis was worshipped on the coasts near Malis (637 n.), but we have no proof that the name <quote lang="greek">Ὀρτυγία</quote> was specially given to her there. Perhaps the poet uses it here merely as one of her standing epithets.</p>

<p>The form <quote lang="greek">ἀνήριθμος</quote> is of a frequent type. When the second part of a compound adj. has a disyllabic stem (usu. a verbal stem), beginning with a short vowel, this vowel may be lengthened. Such forms were oft. convenient in poetry (as <quote lang="greek">ἀνήροτος, εὐήνεμος, φιλήρετμος</quote>), but many of them were equally current in good prose (as <quote lang="greek">ἀνήκεστος, ἀνήνυτος, ἀνηλεῶς, εὐώνυμος</quote>). The restriction of <quote lang="greek">ἀνήριθμος</quote> to classical poetry and late prose (as Athen. p. 253 F) is not due to 1ts form, but to the fact that classical prose preferred <quote lang="greek">ἀναρίθμητος</quote>. Tragedy uses <quote lang="greek">ἀνάριθμος</quote> (<quote lang="greek">α^</quote>) where it suits the metre (as in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 225" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>225</bibl>).

<span class="line-ref">Line 253</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐνιαυτὸν</lemma>. The popular version spoke of three years. This was the term assigned by the mythographer Herodorus (<emph>c.</emph> 430 B.C.?), acc. to the schol.; as it is by Apollodorus (<bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 2.6.2" valid="yes">2. 6. 2</bibl>). If this change was due to Sophocles, we can see the artistic motive. Three months or so, after the bondage, were required for the war in Euboea. If the poet had made Heracles go to Lydia 39, instead of 15, months before his death, there would have been less room for those hopes which contend with fears in the opening scene of the <title>Trachiniae.</title>

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὅθ’ ἁγνὸς ἦν</lemma>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 264</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπερρόθησε</lemma>. This verb can denote the blended sound of many voices (  <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 458" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ch.</title>458</bibl>); esp., the responsive shout of a crowd (  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

Here it refers to loud and vehement railing: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 259" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ant.</title>259</bibl><quote lang="greek">λόγοι...ἐρρόθουν κακοί</quote> (n.), and <emph>ib.</emph> 413 <quote lang="greek">ἐπιρρόθοις</quote> | <quote lang="greek">κακοῖσιν</quote>.</p>
<p>From <quote lang="greek">ἐπερρόθησε</quote> a verb of more general sense, such as <quote lang="greek">ὕβρισε</quote>, is to be supplied with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτηρᾷ φρενί</lemma>. (For the sense of <quote lang="greek">ἀτηρᾷ</quote>, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1272" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>1272</bibl>: Paley wrongly takes it as= ‘deluded.’) This is the easier, since the antithesis between <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γόγοις</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φρενί</lemma> at once suggests a distinction between affronts expressed <emph>in speech</emph> and those which showed the malicious <emph>intention</emph> in another way, viz., by acts: two examples of the verbal insults are given, and then one of the other kind (<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δείπνοις δ)</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign>). Instances of zeugma quite as bold occur elsewhere in poetry; for the Greek mind was quick to seize the hint of a contrast, and did not always require full expression of it: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 15.374" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title>15. 374</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐκ δ’ ἄρα δεσποίνης οὐ μείλιχον ἔστιν ἀκοῦσαι</quote> | <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’ ἔπος οὔτε τι ἔργον</quote> (<emph>sc.</emph> <quote lang="greek">παθεῖν</quote>): <emph>ib.</emph> 20. 312 f. <quote lang="greek">μήλων σφαζομένων οἴνοιό τε πινομένοιο</quote> | <quote lang="greek">καὶ σίτου</quote> (<emph>sc.</emph> <quote lang="greek">ἐσθιομένου</quote>). In these examples, just as here, the antithesis of nouns supersedes an explicit antithesis of verbs.</p>
<p>Others understand :—‘railed against him both with (rude) words and with evil intent.’ To this there are two objections. (1) Since <emph>all</emph> the supposed affronts are then verbal, the antithesis would require an epithet for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λόγοις</lemma> (such as <quote lang="greek">αἰσχροῖς</quote>), to balance <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀτηρᾷ</lemma>. (2) The formula <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πολλὰ μὲν … πολλὰ δέ</lemma> would be out of place, unless two classes of verbal taunts were distinguished by the presence or absence of a spiteful intent; but the context excludes such a distinction.</p>
<p>The text is clearly (I think) sound. It is unwarrantable, as it is undesirable, to strike out <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πολλὰ δ’ … χεροῖν μὲν</lemma> (see cr. n.). Again, it is improbable that a verse has been lost after v. 264.

The length of this ridge, from N. to S. , is about 328 yards: its width about 109. The upper citadel of Tiryns was at the southern end, where the rock attains a height of about 72 feet above sea-level, and of 59 feet above the present surface of the plain. North of this was the lower citadel; and the whole was surrounded by those massive ‘Cyclopean’ walls from which Tiryns derived its Homeric epithet ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πυργώδους πλακός</lemma>. The current version spoke of Heracles as hurling Iphitus from a <emph>wall</emph> or <emph>tower.</emph> Pherecydes the logographer (5th cent. B.C.) is quoted to this effect (schol.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Sic. 4. 31</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τοῦτον μὲν ἀναβιβάσας ὁ Ἡρακλῆς ἐπί τινα πύργον ὑψηλὸν ἐκέλευσεν ἀφορᾶν</quote>. The word <quote lang="greek">πύργος</quote> oft.=a city-wall with its towers ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 56" valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title>56</bibl> n.). Thus it would satisfy all these statements to suppose that Iphitus was thrown from some high part of the walls which encompassed Tiryns <quote lang="greek">τειχιόεσσα</quote>. And by <quote lang="greek">πυργώδης πλάξ</quote> Sophocles may well have meant  ‘the summit of a tower-like <emph>building.</emph>’ Modern critics have usually held that he meant ‘the top of a towering rock or cliff’: and so the schol. here explains, <quote lang="greek">ὑψηλοῦ ὄρους</quote>. We need not press the argument that it is not well-suited to the locality. But it may be doubted whether a Greek poet would have compared a rock or cliff to a <quote lang="greek">πύργος</quote> merely because it was high and steep. On the other hand, where <quote lang="greek">πυργοειδής</quote> occurs elsewhere, it refers to a building. Josephus <title>Bell. Iud.</title> 5. 5. 8 (the <quote lang="greek">Ἀντωνία</quote>, or citadel of Jerusalem) <quote lang="greek">πυργοειδὴς...οὖσα τὸ πᾶν σχῆμα</quote>. Dion Cassius 74. 5 <quote lang="greek">πυρὰ πυργοειδής</quote>. And it is consonant with the style of Tragedy that, in regard to such a detail, the vaguer phrase <quote lang="greek">πυργώδης πλάξ</quote> should be preferred to <quote lang="greek">πλὰξ πύργου</quote>.

Remark, as evidence that this suspected verse is genuine, the thoroughly idiomatic use of the fut. indic. with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἰ</lemma>, in connection with the prayer: ‘if thou <emph>must</emph> do it, at least do it thus.’ So  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 166" valid="yes"> <title>O.

<p>This verse is a development of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μή ποτ’ εἰσίδοιμι</lemma>: ‘may I never <emph>see</emph> it; nay, if it is ever to happen, may it not happen while I <emph>live.</emph>’ Her words unconsciously foreshadow the troubles which, after her death, were brought upon her children by Eurystheus ( Eur. <title>Heracl.</title>). Such an allusion is quite in the poet's manner (cp. n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1080" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ant.</title>1080</bibl> ff.).</p>
<p>The objection to the verse as illogical assumes that the <quote lang="greek">δέ</quote> in <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μηδέ</lemma> means ‘or,’ and that, therefore, the wish ‘not to see’ the woe is <emph>distinguished</emph> from a wish which it includes,—viz., that the woe may not come while she lives. The answer is simply that the <quote lang="greek">δέ</quote> in <quote lang="greek">μηδέ</quote> means ‘and.’

<p><emph>331</emph> Among the attempts to amend <quote lang="greek">λύπην...λύπην</quote> (cr. n.), the two best, I think, are, (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄλλην … λύπην</lemma>, Triclinius: and (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λύπην … διπλῆν</lemma>, F. W. Schmidt. In favour of (2), it might perhaps be said that the second <quote lang="greek">λύπην</quote> is more likely to be corrupt than the first. But it is also conceivable that the error should have arisen through the transcriber glancing forward. And, in close connection with <quote lang="greek">πρὸς κακοῖς τοῖς οὖσιν, <emph>ἄλλην</emph></quote> seems the fittest word. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διπλῆν</lemma> would be less clear (meaning the  former <quote lang="greek">κακά</quote> <emph>plus</emph> a new <quote lang="greek">λύπη</quote>): it would also be too emphatic for this context.</p>
<p>Almost all edd. retain the optat. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λάβοι</lemma>, which is possible (‘Heaven forbid that she should receive...!’). But, as this clause is linked with <quote lang="greek">ἐάσθω καὶ πορευέσθω</quote>,—being, in fact, merely a repetition of the command in a negative form,—I feel sure that Blaydes is right in reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λάβῃ</lemma>.

Ant. 721" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>721</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">φῦναι τὸν ἄνδρα πάντ’ ἐπιστήμης πλέων</quote>, the adverb certainly goes with <quote lang="greek">ἐπιστήμης πλέων</quote>: but that proves nothing against the phrase used here.

<p>The midd. <quote lang="greek">ἐφίσταμαι</quote> does not elsewhere occur in a causal sense (except in the aor., as   <bibl default="NO" n="Xen.

<p>A fact which confirms this view is that <quote lang="greek">ἐφιστάναι, ἐφίστασθαι</quote> were regularly used with ref. to a halt.   <bibl default="NO" n="Xen. Anab. 2. 4. 26" valid="yes">Xen. <title>An.</title>2. 4. 26</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐπορεύετο δὲ ἄλλοτε καὶ ἄλλοτε ἐφιστάμενος. ὅσον δὲ χρόνον τὸ ἡγούμενον τοῦ στρατεύματος ἐπιστήσειε, τοσοῦτον ἦν ἀνάγκη χρόνον δἰ ὅλου τοῦ στρατεύματος γίγνεσθαι τὴν ἐπίστασιν</quote>.

<p>Another explanation is: <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῦ με ἐφίστασαι</lemma>, ‘why hast thou come close up to me, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τήνδε βάσιν</lemma> (cogn. acc.), with this (hurried) step?’ But: (1) instead of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">με</lemma>, we should then expect <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μοι</lemma>: which Madvig, indeed (<bibl default="NO"><title>Adv.</title> 1. 227</bibl>), proposed, though with the further (and needless) change of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῦ</lemma> to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐφ’ οὗ</lemma>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 364</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπιστρατεύει … ἄνακτα πατέρα</lemma>. I keep the traditional text, only with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τόνδ)</lemma> (B) instead of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶνδ)</lemma> (L) in 363: in the poet's time either would have been written <quote lang="greek">ΤΟΝΔ</quote>. If the text be sound, it means:—‘he makes war upon her country, that in which (Lichas) said that this Eurytus was master of the throne.’ But there are three difficulties:</p>
<p>(1) It was needless to say that the girl's <quote lang="greek">πατρίς</quote> was also the realm of Eurytus: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 244" valid="yes">cp. 244</bibl> f.: 283 ff.: 315. The excuse must be that the Messenger himself had not yet said so; he is wordy, and anxious, in his own fashion, to be lucid. The reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τόνδ)</lemma>, it may be noted, suits this view of him. And <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶνδ)</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">θρόνων</quote>) would be very awkward.</p>
<p>(2) Heracles is subject to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπιστρατεύει</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κτείνει</lemma>: but Lichas to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἶπε</lemma>. (Heracles cannot be the subject to <quote lang="greek">εἶπε</quote>: he needed not to tell his warriors that Eurytus <emph>reigned</emph> there; and, on the other hand, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δεσπόζειν</lemma> could not mean, ‘<emph>usurped.</emph>’) Such a change of subject is very harsh: still, it is not impossible; and, as the <emph>narrative</emph> of Lichas has been the foremost topic so far, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἶπε</lemma> would at once suggest him. An example almost as bold occurs in  <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc.  2. 3" valid="yes">Thuc.2. 3</bibl>: <quote lang="greek">οἱ δὲ Πλαταιῆς... λόγους δεξάμενοι ἡσύχαζον, ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐπειδὴ ἐς οὐδένα οὐδὲν ἐνεωτέριζον. πράσσοντες δέ πως ταῦτα κατενόησαν κ.τ.λ.</quote>: where the Plataeans are the subject of <quote lang="greek">ἡσύχαζον</quote> and <quote lang="greek">κατενόησαν</quote>, but the Thebans of <quote lang="greek">ἐνεωτέριζον</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) At v. 377 Deianeira asks, <quote lang="greek">ἆρ’ ἀνώνυμος</quote> | <quote lang="greek">πέφυκεν</quote><emph>; i.e.</emph>, ‘is she of obscure birth?’—and then, for the first time, learns that the girl's father is <title>Eurytus.</title> So she must have understood <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄνακτα</lemma> in 364 to mean, not ‘the king,’ but some (minor) ‘prince’ or ‘chief.’ Yet, even so, her question at v. 377 is strange. (At v. 342 we saw that she ignored a hint given in v. 336: but on <emph>this</emph> question—the girl's birth—we should have expected her to be attentive.)</p>
<p>The only course which removes all these three difficulties is Hartung's,—who brackets the words <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὴν ταύτης … πατέρα</lemma>, so that three verses shrink into one,— <quote lang="greek">ἐπιστρατεύει πατρίδα τῆσδε, καὶ πόλιν κ.τ.λ.</quote> This would certainly improve the passage. And it is conceivable that the interpolation should have been due to actors.</p>
<p>Others read <foreign lang="greek"><emph>τῶν</emph> Εὐρύτου <emph>τόνδ’</emph></foreign>, rendering: ‘in which (Lichas) said that Heracles (<quote lang="greek">τόνδ)</quote>) holds’ [or ‘wishes to hold’] the throne of Eurytus.’ But Heracles simply laid Oechalia waste; there was no question of his reigning there.—Wecklein ingeniously reads <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν ἐργάτην</lemma> (for <quote lang="greek">Εὔρυτον</quote>) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶνδ)</lemma>: ‘where Heracles said (to his warriors) that the author of these wrongs was king.’</p>
<p>For the change of tenses, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 406" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>406</bibl> n.

<p>In some ancient texts this verse was given to Deianeira. Among recent editors, Paley shares that view. But: (1) If Deianeira has already answered her own question, the Messenger's speech opens weakly with v. 380. (2) It agrees best with the practice of Sophocles to suppose that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ κάρτα</lemma> are a speaker's first words. —Some, indeed, of the MSS. (as B, K, T), which give v. 379 to Deianeira, have <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ</lemma> instead of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ</lemma>, with the mark of interrogation after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φύσιν</lemma>, and only a comma after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διώμνυτο</lemma>. Thus  D. asks, ‘Is she obscure, <emph>or</emph> illustrious?’ But this is weak.

<p>Many editors place a comma after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐφώνει</lemma>.

<p>The comment is aimed at Lichas in the  first instance; but its vague form seems purposed, so that the hearers may extend it, if they please, to Heracles. Deianeira herself is in doubt whether the dissimulation practised by Lichas was prompted by her lord (449): Lichas explains that it was not so (479 f.). The schol.'s paraphrase shows that he wished to punctuate thus: <quote lang="greek">ὄλοιντο, μή τι πάντες, οἱ κακοί</quote>, etc.: ‘perish, not all men, but the evil; and (especially) he,’ etc.</p>

(3) Nauck: <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὡς ἕρποντος ἐμοῦ</lemma>, (<quote lang="greek">οὕτως</quote>) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἰσορᾷς</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">ἐμὲ ἕρποντα</quote>). But (<emph>a</emph>) this implies a harsh asyndeton (<quote lang="greek">δίδαξον —εἰσορᾷς</quote>): and (<emph>b</emph>) the constr. is not justified by  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The synizesis of <quote lang="greek">εω</quote>, assumed by those who write <quote lang="greek">κἀνανεώσασθαι</quote>, would be very harsh. I doubt whether Eustathius was right in his theory —suggested by <quote lang="greek">νεᾶν</quote>—that <quote lang="greek">ἀνανεοῦσθαι λόγους</quote> was a metaphor from ploughing.

If these words are sound, they mean, ‘on whom you look with (affected) ignorance.’ There is little force in the objection that Iolè is not actually present: the Messenger is calling up the recent scene (314—319), which is so fresh in their minds. The real question is,—could <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑπ’ ἀγνοίας</lemma> be thus used,—as=‘<emph>with</emph>’ (not ‘<emph>from</emph>’) ‘ignorance’? Elsewhere <quote lang="greek">ὑπό</quote> denotes some external accompaniment of action, as (1) <emph>sound</emph>, <quote lang="greek">ὑπὸ συρίγγων</quote>: or <emph>silence</emph>, <quote lang="greek">ὑπ’ εὐφήμου βοῆς</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Possibly the use of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑπ’ ἀγνοίας</lemma> in this verse may have been felt to convey a certain irony which excused it; as if it implied, ‘with a look of ignorance assumed for the occasion,’—the deceiver's outward equipment for his part.</p>
<p>On the whole, I do not feel sure that there is a corruption. If there is, it probably lies deep. Some conjectures are noticed in the Appendix.

As we could say, <quote lang="greek">τὸ μὴ ἐμοὶ κακόν τι</quote> (‘what is not any ill to me’), so here it seems simplest to carry on the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῦ</lemma>: though it is not necessary to do so.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable passage, and it is of some moment to understand it rightly. The meaning is not merely that Iolè's relation to Heracles was excused by the omnipotence of Erôs. Concubinage (<quote lang="greek">παλλακία</quote>) was not merely tolerated by Athenian opinion, but, in some measure, protected by law (see <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, <bibl default="NO" n="Lys. 1.31" valid="yes">Lys. or. 1 § 31</bibl>: <bibl default="NO" n="Isaeus 8.39" valid="yes">Isae. or. 8 § 39</bibl>). Its relation to the life of the family is illustrated by the <title>Andromachè</title> of Euripides; for though Andromachè is Trojan, and Hermionè Spartan, the sentiments are Athenian. A wife (<quote lang="greek">γαμετὴ γυνή</quote>) who tolerates a <quote lang="greek">παλλακή</quote> is there represented as proving her goodness of heart (<quote lang="greek">ἀρετή</quote>, 226), and her wise moderation (938—942); she ought to be consoled by her higher place, and by the advantage which her children will have over the <quote lang="greek">νόθοι</quote>.</p>
<p>But is Deianeira in earnest here; or is she feigning acquiescence, to reassure Lichas? Presently she tells the Chorus that she cannot endure to share her home with Iolè (539—546). Probably Sophocles meant her to be sincere in both places. The faith in her own power to bear the trial is natural at this moment of excitement and suspense. Not less so is the reaction, when she knows the worst, and has had time to think.

<p>The legendary loves of Heracles were as numerous as the local myths which claimed Heracleid &lt;*&gt;escent for clans or houses. Thus his bride Megara connected him with Thebes; Astydameia, with Thessaly; Astyochè, with Epeirus; Epicastè, with Elis; Parthenopè, with Arcadia; Chalciopè, with Cos; the Thespiades, with Sardinia; and so forth. The number of his sons finally grew to about seventy, whose mothers are enumerated by Apollodorus (2. 7. 8).

Though <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὐδ)</lemma> (‘not even’) goes closely with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εἰ</lemma>, yet <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἂν</lemma> is placed between them: cp. <title>O.C.</title> 272 <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἂν ὧδ’ ἐγιγνόμην κακός</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐντακείη τῷ φιλεῖν</lemma>; the subject to the verb is surely Iolè. To make Heracles the subject is not impossible (Greek could be bold in such transitions),— but it would be excessively harsh. Deianeira has already implied that she believed Iolè to be enamoured of Heracles (444). Such a belief would mitigate,  rather than increase, the wife's pain. The opposite supposition would be still more humiliating; for it would imply more persistent ardour on the part of Heracles. And it is pathetically natural that Deianeira should assume Iolè's passion as a matter of course.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐντακείη</lemma> admits of two explanations: I prefer the first. (1) ‘Though she be utterly <emph>absorbed in</emph> her love’: lit., melted into it,—with her whole soul irrevocably steeped in it. The metaphor is from pouring molten wax or metal into a mould, to which it cleaves. Extant examples of <quote lang="greek">ἐντήκεσθαι</quote> show only the converse way of speaking, as if here we had <quote lang="greek">τὸ φιλεῖν ἐντακείη αὐτῇ</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1311" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>1311</bibl><quote lang="greek">μῖσός τε γὰρ παλαιὸν ἐντέτηκέ μοι</quote>: fr. 856. 7 <quote lang="greek">ἐντήκεται γὰρ</quote> (<quote lang="greek">ἔρως</quote>) <quote lang="greek">πλευμόνων ὅσοις ἔνι</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ψυχή</quote>. But cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1311" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>1311</bibl><quote lang="greek">συγκέκραμαι δύᾳ</quote>:   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Supp. 1029" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Suppl.</title>1029</bibl><quote lang="greek">γαμέτας</quote> | ...<quote lang="greek">συντηχθεὶς ἀλόχῳ</quote> (‘husband <emph>made one with</emph> wife’):   Plut. <title>Mor.</title>p. 342 C <quote lang="greek">ταῖς ἐλπίσιν ἤδη...ἐμπεφυκώς</quote> (‘absorbed in’ his hopes). (2) The other possible sense is, ‘be melted,’ ‘languish,’ <emph>with</emph> love; <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῷ φιλεῖν</lemma> being then instrum. dat. This is, however, a weaker meaning, and less appropriate. For: (<emph>a</emph>) it would imply an <emph>unsatisfied</emph> longing; and (<emph>b</emph>) Deianeira's thought is rather this:—‘I will not be harsh to her, even though she be resolved <emph>never to renounce</emph> his love.’</p>
<p>The conject. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκτακείη</lemma> is no improvement: it would mean ‘waste away’:   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Orest. 860" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Or.</title>860</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐξετηκόμην γόοις</quote>.

Il. 21.237" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>21. 237</bibl>). <quote lang="greek">ἐντεῦθεν ὁρμηθέντες</quote> (says the schol. there) <quote lang="greek">τὸν Ἀχελῷον ἐταύρωσαν Ἡρακλεῖ ἀγωνιζόμενον</quote>. The taurine form was given to Acheloüs, in that combat, by Archilochus (schol. <emph>ib.</emph>), by Pindar (schol.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 21.194" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>21. 194</bibl>), and by the logographer Pherecydes ( <bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 2.6" valid="yes">Apollod.2. 6. 5</bibl>): perhaps, too, by Panyasis, the author of an epic <quote lang="greek">Ἡράκλεια</quote>. An engraved  gem in the British Museum (King, <title>Antique Gems</title> II. pl. 34, fig. 3) shows Acheloüs as a bull, preparing to butt at Heracles. The gem is older than the time of Sophocles, and may, as Mr.   Murray S. thinks, have followed the rendering of this subject on the still more archaic throne of Apollo at Amyclae ( <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 3. 18. 5" valid="yes">Paus.3. 18. 5</bibl>). Cp. n. on 520. This fight was a favourite theme in art: for the literature, see Roscher,   <title>Lex.</title>p. 9.</p>
<p>Ovid (<bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Met. 9.1" valid="yes"><title>Met.</title> 9. 1—100</bibl>) departs from the old Greek version: his Acheloüs begins the fight in quasi-human form,—then turns into a serpent <bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Met. 9.63" valid="yes">(63)</bibl>,—and then, as a last resource into a bull <bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Met. 9.80" valid="yes">(80)</bibl>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 526</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">†ἐγὼ δὲ μάτηρ† μὲν οἷα φράζω</lemma>. The words <quote lang="greek">ἐγὼ δὲ μάτηρ</quote> (if no others) are unquestionably corrupt. They have been explained to mean:—‘I speak as a mother’ (or ‘her mother’) ‘might speak’: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, with all a mother's tender sympathy. If anything could increase the strangeness of such language, it would be the fact that the young maidens of Trachis are speaking of one who is old enough to be <emph>their</emph> mother. Or: (2) ‘I tell the story as her mother told it,’—a way of explaining how they can describe what they had not seen. This needs no refutation.</p>
<p>The true key to this passage depends on observing the sequence of topics. (1) In 517—522, <quote lang="greek">τότ’ ἦν χερός...στόνος ἀμφοῖν</quote>, we have a brief picture of the fight. (2) Then vv. 523—525, <quote lang="greek">ἁ δ’ εὐῶπις...ἀκοίταν</quote>, mark Deianeira's suspense. (3) Next comes the obscure parenthesis, <quote lang="greek">ἐγὼ δὲ...φράζω</quote>. (4) And then we <emph>return</emph>, at v. 527, to Deianeira's suspense,—not, however, in a form which adds anything new to vv. 523 —525, but in one which merely repeats their substance:—<quote lang="greek">τὸ δ’ ἀμφινείκητον...ἀμμένει</quote>.</p>
<p>Now, to justify such a repetition, it is manifest that (2) and (4) should be separated, not by a mere parenthesis, such as (3) now is, but by some further allusion to <emph>the fight.</emph> This inference is strengthened by the phrase, <quote lang="greek">τὸ δ’ ἀμφινείκητον ὄμμα νύμφας</quote>, which gains point if a reference to the <quote lang="greek">νεῖκος</quote> has immediately preceded.</p>
<p>I believe that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐγὼ</lemma> has come from <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγὼν</lemma>, under the influence of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φράζω</lemma>. The sense of the verse was, ‘And the strife goes on raging, as I describe’ (referring to vv. 517—522). <quote lang="greek">ΜΑΤΗΡ</quote> may well be a corruption of <quote lang="greek">ΜΑΡΓΑΙ</quote>, a loss of <quote lang="greek">Ρ</quote> having been followed by a change of <quote lang="greek">Γ</quote> to <quote lang="greek">Τ</quote>. This may have happened after <quote lang="greek">ἀγὼν</quote> had become <quote lang="greek">ἐγὼ</quote>, with help, perhaps, from a reminiscence of  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 233" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>233</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ οὖν εὐνοίᾳ γ’ αὐδῶ</quote>, | <quote lang="greek">μάτηρ ὡσεί τις πιστά</quote>. Cp. Hesychius <quote lang="greek">μαργᾷ· μαργαίνει, ὑβρίζει, ἐνθουσιᾷ, μαίνεται</quote>.   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Her. 1005" valid="yes">Eur. <title>H. F.</title>1005</bibl><quote lang="greek">ὅς νιν φόνου μαργῶντος ἔσχε</quote>. I would read, then, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγὼν δὲ μαργᾷ μέν, οἷα φράζω</lemma>. The next words, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸ δ’ ἀμφινείκητον</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign>, then fiftly turn from the stubborn fight to her continuing suspense.—For other views, see Appendix.

Sophocles does not tell us whether Heracles took his bride away from her father's home immediately after the fight. According to the common account Heracles and Deianeira remained with Oeneus for a considerable time after their  marriage, while the hero did various exploits.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄφαρ</lemma> is not necessarily inconsistent with that version: it means merely that the result of the fight at once transferred Deianeira from the care of her mother to that of a husband.

<p> The text of this passage is, I believe, sound, though the diction is bold, and somewhat careless. The <emph>one</emph> <quote lang="greek">ἥβη</quote> (Iolè's) is growing to the perfect flower, while the other (Deianeira's) is declining. (Cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Lys. 596" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Lys.</title>596</bibl><quote lang="greek">τῆς δὲ γυναικὸς σμικρὸς ὁ καιρός</quote>.) In what follows, these points may be noted.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὧν</lemma>, fem., refers to the two phases of <quote lang="greek">ἥβη</quote> just mentioned. The gen. is partitive: ‘of (out of) these <quote lang="greek">ἧβαι</quote>, the eye delights in the <quote lang="greek">ἄνθος</quote>.’ Here <quote lang="greek">ἄνθος</quote> is a shorter way of expressing <quote lang="greek">τὴν ἀνθοῦσαν</quote>,—the <quote lang="greek">ἥβη</quote> which is in its early bloom. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὧν</lemma> could not, surely, refer to <quote lang="greek">τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσαν πρόσω</quote> <emph>only</emph>, as if it meant <quote lang="greek">τῶν νέων γυναικῶν</quote> (schol.): it must refer to <quote lang="greek">τὴν δὲ φθίνουσαν</quote> also. Nor, again, could <quote lang="greek">ὦν</quote> stand for <quote lang="greek">ὧν τῆς μέν</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶν δ’ ὑπεκτρέπει πόδα</lemma>. Here <quote lang="greek">τῶν δ)</quote> ought in strictness to have been <quote lang="greek">τῆς δ)</quote>, <emph>sc.</emph> <quote lang="greek">τῆς φθινούσης ἥβης</quote>. But, in the poet's thought, <quote lang="greek">τῶν δ)</quote> means, ‘<emph>the other kind</emph>,’— <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the women who represent the <quote lang="greek">φθίνουσα ἥβη</quote>. The subject to <quote lang="greek">ὑπεκτρέπει</quote> is not <quote lang="greek">ὀφθαλμός</quote>, but the <emph>man</emph> implied by it (<quote lang="greek">ὁ ὁρῶν</quote>). The eye, as being here the guide of the choice, might, indeed, be said to ‘turn the foot aside,’ in the sense of <emph>causing</emph> that movement; but this would be awkward.

<p>(3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀφαρπάζειν</lemma>, said of the eye, means, to <emph>seize eagerly upon</emph> the beautiful sight (cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hor.

For the adj., cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 635" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>635</bibl><quote lang="greek">λυτηρίους</quote> | <quote lang="greek">εὐχὰς...δειμάτων</quote>: <emph>ib.</emph> 1490 <quote lang="greek">τόδ’ ἂν κακῶν μόνον γένοιτο τῶν πάλαι λυτήριον</quote>: fr. 687 <quote lang="greek">τὸ μεθύειν πημονῆς λυτήριον</quote>. Clearly, then, <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote> is sound: and it must mean, as everywhere else, ‘giving deliverance.’ The corrupt word is <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λύπημα</lemma>: it has displaced some word of which <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote> could be the epithet. I believe that Sophocles wrote <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λώφημα</lemma>, ‘a means of <emph>relief.</emph>’ Hesychius shows that this noun was not only current, but tolerably familiar; for he has <quote lang="greek">λῶφαρ· λώφημα</quote>,—using it to explain the rarer form. The corruption into <quote lang="greek">λύπημα</quote> probably arose through a marginal gloss, <quote lang="greek">λύπης</quote>, on <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote>.</p>
<p>Deianeira is here speaking of an expedient which gives her some hope, indeed, but no assured confidence (590 f.). This exactly suits the usage of <quote lang="greek">λωφᾶν</quote> and its derivatives, which denote the <emph>alleviation</emph> of evil,—not its complete removal. Cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 61" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>61</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἐπειδὴ τοῦδ’ ἐλώφησεν πόνου</quote>.  <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc.  6. 12" valid="yes">Thuc.6. 12</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀπὸ νόσου μεγάλης καὶ πολέμου βραχύ τι λελωφήκα&lt;*&gt;εν</quote>.  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

Thuc. uses <quote lang="greek">λώφησις</quote>, ‘abatement’ (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 4.81" valid="yes">4. 81</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τοῦ πολέμου</quote></cit>). Deianeira, in bethinking her of the philtre, has found that which holds out a promise of deliverance, and <emph>assuages</emph>, though it does not cure, her pain,—a <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον λώφημα</quote>.</p>
<p>The attempted versions of <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον λύπημα</quote> have been these:—(1) With a comma after <quote lang="greek">τῇδ)</quote>: ‘a thing to grieve this girl, for my deliverance’:—a grammatically sound phrase, but wholly unsuited to Deianeira, whose aim is to be <emph>more loved than</emph> Iolè (584 ff.),—but not to pain her. (2) Taking <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">λυτόν</quote>: ‘how I find that my pain is remediable.’ This is impossible. (3) Governing <quote lang="greek">λύπημα</quote> by <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote>: ‘how I have a thing to remedy my pain.’ Also impossible.</p>
<p>Paley, changing <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔχω</lemma> to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔχει</lemma>, renders, ‘in what way my grief has <emph>a remedy</emph>’— making <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote> a subst. This is clearly untenable. He cites   <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 5" valid="yes">Pind. <title>P.</title>5. 106</bibl><quote lang="greek">τὸ καλλίνικον λυτήριον δαπανᾶν</quote> | <quote lang="greek">μέλος χαρίεν</quote>: but there <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον</quote> is a second epithet of <quote lang="greek">μέλος</quote>. Nor is the case helped by Hesychius, <quote lang="greek">λυτήριον· φυλακτήριον.— <emph>τῇδ) ὑμῖν φράσω</emph></quote>: the words mean strictly that the story will follow the course— <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, will exhibit the line of thought—by which the remedy has been found.

The peculiarity is that <quote lang="greek">στόλος</quote> here=<quote lang="greek">πέμψις</quote>, corresponding to the sense of the act. <quote lang="greek">στέλλω</quote>: whereas it usu. means ‘expedition,’ ‘journey,’ from midd. <quote lang="greek">στέλλομαι</quote>.

<p>The soundness of the words is confirmed by their dramatic fitness.

The words also accord with that tone of passivity in which she has already spoken of her marriage (6—27).

In <title>Journ. Hellen.

Similar subjects occur on coins of Eastern Macedonia. Violence of this kind was part of the <quote lang="greek">ὕβρις</quote> (1096) ascribed to the savage Centaurs, and appears in numerous legends (<title>J. H.

When the arrow was withdrawn from the wound, there would be a gush of blood, but some parts of the blood would have been more affected by the venom than others; and Nessus wishes her to take the most envenomed parts. The stress is on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μελαγχόλους</lemma>, and the whole phrase is a compressed way of saying, <quote lang="greek">ᾗ μέλας χόλος ἐστίν, &lt;*&gt; ἰοὺς ὕδρα ἔβαψεν</quote> (cp.    <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>Others explain thus:—‘If thou gather the blood from my wound, clotted around (<emph>the arrow</emph>), at the place where the hydra has tinged it,’ etc., <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, at the arrow's <emph>head.</emph> This is quite possible, but is open to objections. (1) The language in 557 f. (<quote lang="greek">παρὰ Νέσσου...ἐκ φονῶν</quote>) implies that she obtained the blood directly from the body, not from the arrow-head. (2) The phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐνέγκῃ χερσίν</lemma> here favours the same view.</p>
<p>If we adopted the conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μελάγχολος … ἰός</lemma>, the latter word would mean ‘venom,’ and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θρέμμα</lemma> ‘issue’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>Ovid describes the incident thus:—The arrow is withdrawn, and the blood flows from the wound, <quote lang="la">mixtus Lernaei tabe veneni:</quote> Nessus then presents Deianeira with a garment steeped in the blood (<quote lang="la">velamina tincta cruore</quote>):  <bibl default="NO" n="Ov.

(1) It is clear that <quote lang="greek">αὐτὴν</quote> means merely <emph>eam</emph>, not <emph>ipsam.</emph> We cannot distinguish <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὰ τῆς ξένης προσδέγματα</lemma>, as meaning the welcome of Iolè <emph>along with the other captives</emph>, from a special welcome given to Iolè personally. (2) <quote lang="greek">αὐτὴν</quote>, although unemphatic, has a position which would usually give emphasis. But this is excused by the fact that the whole clause, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτὴν ὡς ἐδεξάμην φίλως</lemma>, depends on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οἶσθα</lemma>, being merely epexegetic of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὰ τῆς ξένης προσδέγματα</lemma> (instead of <quote lang="greek">οἷα ἐγένετο</quote> or the like). The chief stress falls on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φίλως</lemma>. (3) If, however, we had <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτήν θ)</lemma>, then the sentence would lose that compact unity which justifies the place of the pronoun. And so <quote lang="greek">αὐτήν θ)</quote> would naturally seem to mean <emph>ipsam</emph>,—raising the objection noticed above (1). The insertion of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θ)</lemma> may easily have arisen from a notion that the second clause required a link with the first.

Anachronisms were tolerated by Attic Tragedy, but this is hardly one, from the Greek point of view. The Thessalian and Dorian nucleus of what became the ‘Delphic’ Amphictyony was of immemorial age; Amphictyon was called the son of Deucalion; Acrisius of Argos figured in tradition as an early organiser of the league ( <bibl default="NO" n="Strab. 9.420" valid="yes">Strabo 9.420</bibl>).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἑλλάνων</lemma>, implying a Panhellenic character, reflects the regular phraseology of the poet's day. The Delphic Amphictyony never actually represented the whole even of Greece Proper; thus it never included the Acarnanians, Arcadians, or Eleans. Yet  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 7. 214" valid="yes">Her.7. 214</bibl> speaks of <quote lang="greek">οἱ τῶν Ἑλλάνων Πυλαγόροι</quote>: an Argive inscr., older than 416 B.C., calls the Council <quote lang="greek">τὸ συνέδριον τῶν Ἑλλάνων</quote> (Lebas, <title>Revue Archéol.</title> XI. 577): and Hypereides <title>Epitaph.</title> c. 8. 25 describes those attending it as <quote lang="greek">οἱ Ἕλληνες ἅπαντες</quote>.</p>

The traditional text here, <quote lang="greek">τᾶς πειθοῦς παγχρίστῳ</quote> | <quote lang="greek">συγκραθεὶς ἐπὶ προφάσει θηρός</quote>, makes a long syllable answer to the second of <quote lang="greek">ἐξέλυς)</quote>, and to the second of <quote lang="greek">ἁμέραν</quote>.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the text in detail.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παγχρίστῳ</lemma> does not look like a gloss. Dindorf, who thinks it one, can only suggest that it arose from <quote lang="greek">πάγχριστος</quote>, a gloss upon <quote lang="greek">συγκραθείς</quote>. This is hardly probable. Sophocles is fond of intensive compounds with <quote lang="greek">πᾶς</quote>: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 505" valid="yes">cp. 505</bibl>, 652:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 851" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>851</bibl><quote lang="greek">πανσύρτῳ, παμμήνῳ</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1282" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>1282</bibl><quote lang="greek">παμμήτωρ</quote>: fr. 347 <quote lang="greek">πάγξενος</quote>, etc. As an epithet for the robe, <quote lang="greek">παγχρίστῳ</quote>, ‘thoroughly anointed,’ is suitable. (Cp. Deianeira's words in 580.) But it cannot be a subst., as the schol. on 663 would make it (<quote lang="greek">λείπει τῷ πέπλῳ</quote>).</p>
<p>(2) The words <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπὶ προφάσει θηρός</lemma>= <quote lang="greek">ἐπίπονον ἁμέραν</quote> in 654. Besides being unmetrical, <quote lang="greek">θηρός</quote> requires an unexampled sense for <quote lang="greek">προφάσει</quote>, viz., ‘precept.’ Hence Dindorf reads <quote lang="greek">προφάνσει</quote> (a word which is not extant), and in 654 <quote lang="greek">ἐπιπόνων ἁμερᾶν</quote>. For <quote lang="greek">θηρός</quote>, M. Haupt conjectured <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φάρους</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">ΘΗΡΟΣ, ΦΑΡΟΣ</quote>): for the <quote lang="greek">α^</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 916" valid="yes">cp. 916</bibl>. The words <quote lang="greek">ἐπὶ προφάσει φάρους</quote> then mean, ‘on the pretext of the robe.’ The robe was the <quote lang="greek">πρόφασις</quote> for using the love-charm. <quote lang="greek">παγχρίστῳ</quote> can be retained in the dat., agreeing with <quote lang="greek">προφάσει</quote> (cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 794" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>794</bibl> n.).</p>
<p>(3) For <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">συγκραθεὶς</lemma>, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1311" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>1311</bibl><quote lang="greek">δειλαίᾳ δὲ συγκέκραμαι δύᾳ</quote> (‘steeped in’ it):  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 895" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>895</bibl><quote lang="greek">οἴκτῳ τῷδε συγκεκραμένην</quote> (‘steeped in this lament,’—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, in the anguish of it).  <title>Plut.</title> 853 <quote lang="greek">οὕτω πολυφόρῳ συγκέκραμαι δαίμονι</quote>. Thus the primary sense of <emph>mixture</emph>, or <emph>fusion</emph>, led to that of intimate union. If we accept <quote lang="greek">φάρους</quote>, then <quote lang="greek">συγκραθεὶς</quote> would be most naturally taken in the sense which <quote lang="greek">πανίμερος</quote>, just before it, could suggest,— ‘made one in heart’ with Deianeira.</p>
<p>There remains, however, the metrical discrepancy between <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">συγκραθεὶς</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξέλυς)</lemma> in 654. Hermann read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξείλυς)</lemma> (‘unrolled,’ meaning, ‘disentangled,’ ‘brought to a smooth close’). But <quote lang="greek">ἐξέλυς)</quote>  seems genuine. It is possible, however, that <quote lang="greek">συγκραθεὶς</quote> was an explanation of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">συντακεὶς</lemma> (suggested by Paley), which would give the same sense. Cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Supp. 1029" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Suppl.</title>1029</bibl><quote lang="greek">γαμέτας</quote> | <quote lang="greek">συντηχθεὶς αὔραις ἀδόλοις</quote> | <quote lang="greek">γενναίας ἀλόχῳ ψυχᾶς</quote>, ‘husband <emph>made one with</emph> wife in the sincere spirit of a loyal soul.’ So <quote lang="greek">συντακείς τινι</quote>, of close attachment,   <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Sym. 183E" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Symp.</title> 183E</bibl><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Sym. 192" valid="yes">Plat. Symp., 192</bibl></p>
<p>Either <quote lang="greek">συγκραθείς</quote> or <quote lang="greek">συντακείς</quote> would here admit a secondary sense, unconsciously prophetic of the dire event (833 <quote lang="greek">προστακέντος ἰοῦ</quote>: 836 <quote lang="greek">προστετακώς</quote>),— like <quote lang="greek">προσαρμόσαι</quote> in 494.—For other views, see Appendix.

The latter reading, if sound, presents a dilemma. (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀργῆτ)</lemma>=<quote lang="greek">ἀργῆτι</quote>. But it is now generally recognised that the epic license of eliding datival <quote lang="greek">ι</quote> was foreign to Attic Tragedy: the supposed examples all admit of easy remedy: see  <title>O. C.</title>, Appendix on v. 1436. (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀργῆτα</lemma>, agreeing with <quote lang="greek">πέπλον</quote>: ‘white, glistering.’ This is possible; for, though <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν ἐνδυτῆρα πέπλον</lemma> precedes, a second epithet might follow: cp. n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1199." valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title>1199.</bibl>But the effect of such an epithet, added at the end of the clause, would here be very weak. And if <quote lang="greek">ἀργῆτα</quote> is taken as the proleptic predicate (‘anointed so as to make it shine,’ Wecklein), this does not suit the sense.

The question must be considered in the light of the whole context. She begins by saying that the Centaur's dying precepts remained in her memory as if graven on bronze (680—683). That passage is much more impressive if a full stop follows 683. She then says, ‘Now <emph>these</emph> were his precepts,’— verse 684 marking her anxiety to explain that she had simply obeyed him to the letter. The reiteration, <quote lang="greek">κἄδρων τοιαῦτα</quote>, in 688, is unnecessary; but, in her actual state of mind, it is full of dramatic truth. The scholiast read this verse.

<span class="line-ref">Line 714</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄτρακτον</lemma>: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 290" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>290</bibl> n.—</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεὸν Χείρωνα</lemma>. Cheiron, as the son of the god Cronus by the nymph Philyra, was of a different origin from the other Centaurs, the descendants of Ixion and Nephelè. So Pindar distinguishes him as <quote lang="greek">Κρονίδαν</quote> | <quote lang="greek">Κένταυρον</quote> (<title>N.</title> 3. 47), <quote lang="greek">οὐρανίδα γόνον εὐρυμέδοντα Κρόνου</quote> (<title>P.</title> 3. 4): and Apollonius Rhodius as <quote lang="greek">ἄλλα μὲν ἵππῳ</quote>, | <quote lang="greek">ἄλλα θεῷ ἀτάλαντον</quote> (2. 1240). He was still more separated from the rest of the Centaur tribe by his just and gentle character ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 11.832" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>11. 832</bibl><quote lang="greek">δικαιότατος Κενταύρων</quote>). Hence Greek art, after the in vention of the hippo-centaur (564 n.), continued to portray Cheiron under the more humane type of the andro-centaur. This is his form on Greek vases, down at least to 400 B.C. Later art neglected this distinction. (See  Colvin S. in <title>Journ. Hellen. Stud.</title>, vol. 1. pp. 133— 137.)</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πημήναντα</lemma>. Other Centaurs, routed by Heracles in Arcadia, fled to Cheiron near Cape Malea; and the hero, in shooting at them, accidentally wounded his friend. Cheiron could not be healed; and, being a god, could not die. At last Zeus allowed him to exchange fates, the immortal for the mortal, with Prometheus; and so he found rest ( <bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 2.5.4" valid="yes">Apollod.2. 5. 4</bibl>).</p>
<p>Ovid varies the story. Heracles visited Cheiron on Mount Pelion; a poisoned arrow chanced to fall from the hero's quiver on the left foot of the Centaur. <cit><quote lang="la">Virus edax superabat opem...Nona dies aderat, cum tu, iustissime Chiron, | Bis septem stellis corpore cinctus eras.</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Fast. 5.387" valid="yes">（<title>Fast.</title> 5. 387—414.)</bibl></cit></p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χὧνπερ</lemma> seems a certain correction of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χὥσπερ</lemma>. The latter has been explained thus:—(1) ‘Even as it may touch, (so surely) does it destroy.’ This is possible, but somewhat forced; certainly less probable than <quote lang="greek">χὧνπερ</quote>. (2) ‘<title>If only</title> it touch them.’ This view—that <quote lang="greek">ὥσπερ &lt;*&gt;ν</quote>=<emph>dummodo</emph>—rests on passages in which <quote lang="greek">ὡς</quote> should be corrected to <quote lang="greek">ἕως</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1361" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>1361</bibl>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1330" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>1330</bibl>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 1117" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>1117</bibl>).—Few will defend <quote lang="greek">χὥσπερ</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">καὶ ὅσπερ</quote> (‘whoever touches the arrow’); or accept, with Wunder, <quote lang="greek">χὥσαπερ</quote>.

<p>Others take <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκ … τοῦδε</lemma> as=‘from this arrow’: then <quote lang="greek">σφαγῶν</quote> must go either with <quote lang="greek">διελθών</quote>, ‘having come through (from) the wounds’; or with <quote lang="greek">αἵματος</quote>,  ‘poison contained in the blood of the wounds.’ But the point is that the poison, though it comes to Heracles from the wound of Nessus, and not (as to its former victims) <emph>directly</emph> from the arrow, is still the same.

<span class="line-ref">Line 764</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κόσμῳ τε … καὶ στολῇ</lemma>=<quote lang="greek">κοσμίᾳ στολῇ</quote>. So in   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Med. 1165" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Med.</title>1165</bibl>Glauce puts on the deadly gifts of Medea, <quote lang="greek">δώροις ὑπερχαίρουσα.—<emph>κατηύχετο</emph></quote>: as Chryses <quote lang="greek">μεγάλ’ εὔχετο χεῖρας ἀνασχών</quote>, at the sacrifice described in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 1.447" valid="yes"> <title>Il.</title>1. 447</bibl>—466; and as Nestor <quote lang="greek">πολλὰ...Ἀθήνῃ</quote> | <quote lang="greek">εὔχετ)</quote> on the like occasion in  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 3.430" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title>3. 430</bibl>—463. Those two passages explain the ritual imagined here (vv. 756—766). (1) Heracles, having put on the robe, brings his victims to the altar. (2) The next act would be to sprinkle the <quote lang="greek">χέρνιψ</quote> on the sacrificers; who would then take barleymeal (<quote lang="greek">οὐλοχύται</quote>) in the hands from the basket, <quote lang="greek">κανοῦν</quote>. (3) Then Heracles offers his prayer to Zeus. (4) The actual immolation follows; the barley-meal is sprinkled on the heads of victims; hair, cut from one or more of them, is thrown on the altar-fire; and they are slain. (5) The <quote lang="greek">μηρία</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1011" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>1011</bibl>), doubly wrapped in fat, are burnt on the altar. This act was in progress, when the agonies of Heracles began.</p>
<p>Several critics alter <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατηύχετο</lemma> to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατήρχετο</lemma>. The latter, if used in its larger sense, would refer to no. 2 of the stages described above (cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 3.445" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title>3. 445</bibl><quote lang="greek">χέρνιβά τ’ οὐλοχύτας τε κατήρχετο</quote>); if in its narrower sense, to no. 4 (cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Birds 959" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Av.</title>959</bibl>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 2. 45" valid="yes">Her.2. 45</bibl>). The larger sense would be best here.</p>
<p>But <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατηύχετο</lemma> is an immeasurably finer reading. Heracles, standing before the altar as he prays with uplifted hands to Zeus, is thrown into stronger relief than if imagined merely in the brief act denoted by <quote lang="greek">κατήρχετο</quote>. The <quote lang="greek">ἵλεως φρήν</quote>, too, would be more apparent in the <quote lang="greek">εὐχή</quote> than in the rite.

<span class="line-ref">Line 767</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἱδρὼς</lemma>, showing that the irritant action of the poison has begun.— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀρτίκολλος, ὥστε τέκτονος</lemma>, closely glued to his flesh as if by a craftsman: schol. <quote lang="greek">ὡς ὑπὸ τέκτονος καλῶς συγκεκολλημένος</quote>. The gen. here is not so definitely equivalent to a gen. with <quote lang="greek">ὑπό</quote> as it is in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 807" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>807</bibl><quote lang="greek">φωτὸς ἠπατημένη</quote>, or   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Orest. 497" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Or.</title>497</bibl><quote lang="greek">πληγεὶς θυγατρός</quote>.  Eur. Itexpresses a similar notion, but in a vaguer form: ‘like something <emph>from</emph> (the hand of) a <quote lang="greek">τέκτων</quote>’: ‘like (a work) of his.’ Some supply <quote lang="greek">κολλήσαντος</quote>: but this seems difficult, and is not warranted by such examples as <quote lang="greek">ὡς ἐμοῦ μόνης πέλας</quote> (<emph>sc.</emph> <quote lang="greek">οὔσης</quote>,  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 83" valid="yes">Soph. <title>O. C.</title>83</bibl>).</p>
<p>Some have supposed that the <quote lang="greek">χιτών</quote> is compared to (stone or bronze) drapery on a statue. <quote lang="greek">τέκτων</quote> could certainly mean a sculptor:   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Alc. 348" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Alc.</title>348</bibl><quote lang="greek">σοφῇ δὲ χειρὶ τεκτόνων τὸ σὸν δέμας</quote> | <quote lang="greek">εἰκασθέν</quote>. But: (1) There would be little point in comparing a real robe to an imitation in art. (2) Cp. fr. 430. 4, where Pelops is responding, with his eyes, to the glance of Hippodameia, and the discreet limit which the lover's instinct observes is compared to the line traced by a craftsman's rule;—<quote lang="greek">ἴσον μετρῶν ὀφθαλμόν, ὥστε τέκτονος</quote> | <quote lang="greek">παρὰ στάθμην ἰόντος ὀρθοῦται κανών</quote>. There, then, as here, the simile is from a mechanical process: the <quote lang="greek">τέκτων</quote> is suggested there by <quote lang="greek">ἴσον μετρῶν</quote>, as here by <quote lang="greek">ἀρτίκολλος</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἅπαν κατ’ ἄρθρον</lemma>: the robe clings so tight as to show the contour of the body: cp. the Homeric phrase, <quote lang="greek">ἐντυπὰς ἐν χλαίνῃ κεκαλυμμένος</quote>, explained to mean, <quote lang="greek">ὥστε διὰ τοῦ ἱματίου τοῦ σώματος τὸν τύπον φαίνεσθαι</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀστέων</lemma> might be joined with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀντίσπαστος</lemma> (=<quote lang="greek">ἀντισπῶν τὰ ὀστᾶ</quote>), but is more simply taken with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀδαγμός</lemma>. The latter word means ‘a biting pain’ (rt <quote lang="greek">δακ</quote>), esp. an ‘itching.’ Photius p. 7 21: <quote lang="greek">ἀδαγμὸς ὁ ὀδαξησμός, ὅπερ ἐστὶ κνησμός· οὕτω Σοφοκλῆς</quote>. The forms <quote lang="greek">ὀδάξω</quote> (act. and midd.) and <quote lang="greek">ἀδαξέω</quote> (do.) seem both to have been in use; the former was perhaps chiefly Ionic.

This seems impossible. (2) <quote lang="greek">διαρραγέντος</quote>, or the like (see cr. n.), should be read. But <quote lang="greek">διασπαρέντος</quote>, rightly understood, suits both nouns. Athenaeus (66 A) quotes vv. 781 f., as cited by Apollodorus (<emph>c.</emph> 140 B.C.), without variation from our text. The reading, then, is at least a very old one.

Anintrans. <quote lang="greek">ἐκφέρειν</quote> occurs elsewhere only as meaning ‘to shoot ahead’ in a race: see on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1424" valid="yes"> <title>O. C.</title>1424</bibl>(where <quote lang="greek">ἐκφέρει</quote> is best taken as 2nd pers. pres. midd., ‘fulfil for thyself’). But the sense found here is parallel with that of the intrans. <quote lang="greek">ἐκδιδόναι</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἐξιέναι</quote>, as said of rivers, ‘to issue.’</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δωδέκατος ἄροτος</lemma>: the twelfth year from the time when the oracle was given at Dodona: see n. on 44. Apollodorus names the same term, though, acc. to his version, the oracle was given at Delphi (2. 4. 12).</p>
<p>This is the only passage of the play which mentions the period of twelve years. In 44 f. and 164 f., the reference is merely to the fifteen months which, when Heracles left home, were still wanting to those twelve years. It may be asked, then, whence the Chorus derive their knowledge of the twelve years; for Deianeira, in 155 ff., speaks as if they had not then heard of the oracle. The answer is simply that this inconsistency of detail was overlooked by the poet; the term of twelve years was in his mind, as a familiar part of the story; and he forgot that, if the Chorus were to know it, Deianeira ought to have mentioned it.</p>
<p>Needless difficulties have been made  by assuming that the allusion here must be to the fifteen months of 44 f. and 164 f. Even then, however, it has to be supposed that ‘twelve months’ are put loosely for ‘fifteen.’</p>

Trach. 1058" valid="yes">cp. 1058</bibl>—1063.</p>
<p>The doubt as to the reading here is confined to the words between <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόποι</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπέμολε</lemma>. The traditional text is, <quote lang="greek">οἷον ἀναρσίων</quote> | <quote lang="greek">οὔπω ἀγακλειτὸν Ἡρακλέους</quote>. The <emph>v. l.</emph> <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλέα</quote>, found in a few of the later MSS., was apparently prompted by <quote lang="greek">ἀγακλειτόν</quote>. In the corresponding vv. of the strophe (841 ff.), the MS. text is, <quote lang="greek">μεγάλαν προσορῶσα δόμοις βλάβαν</quote> | <quote lang="greek">νέων ἀϊσσόντων γάμων, τὰ μὲν οὔ τι</quote>: where the only doubt affecting metre is between <quote lang="greek">δόμοις</quote> and <quote lang="greek">δόμοισι</quote>.</p>
<p>It seems almost certain that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἡρακλέους</lemma> was a gloss, and that <quote lang="greek">τὰ μὲν οὔ τι</quote> in the strophe answered metrically to <quote lang="greek">ἀγακλειτόν</quote> here. The proposed emendations of this passage are classified in the Appendix. Those which eject <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλέους</quote> follow one of two methods. (1) To read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμοις</lemma>, not <quote lang="greek">δόμοισι</quote>, in 842: to insert a long syllable, beginning with a vowel (as <quote lang="greek">ἐξ</quote>), before <quote lang="greek">ἀναρσίων</quote>: and to supply something, equal to <quote lang="greek">˘¯</quote> (as <quote lang="greek">ποτ’ ἄνδῤ</quote>), between <quote lang="greek">οὔπω</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἀγακλειτόν</quote>. (2) To read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δόμοισι</lemma> in 842: and to make such an addition to <quote lang="greek">οὔπω</quote> as shall metrically balance <quote lang="greek">ἀϊσσόντων γάμων</quote>. On this plan, I suggest <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">&lt;ὕπ)&gt; οὔπω &lt;τοῦδε σῶμ)&gt; ἀγακλειτόν</lemma>. The prep. goes with <quote lang="greek">ἀναρσίων</quote>, which, without a prep., would here be somewhat harsh (as=‘from his foes’). <quote lang="greek">Ἡρακλέους</quote> would have been a gloss on <quote lang="greek">το&lt;*&gt;ε</quote>. Sophocles is fond of the periphrasis with  <quote lang="greek">σῶμα</quote>, which would be fitting here: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p> These eight verses form an epode to the stasimon; three persons take part in the delivery, viz., the two <quote lang="greek">παραστάται</quote>, or leaders of <quote lang="greek">ἡμιχόρια</quote> (HM. A, HM. B), and the coryphaeus (XO.). The third part (868—870) is best assigned to the coryphaeus, who usually announces a new comer, and who would naturally conduct the dialogue with the <quote lang="greek">τροφός</quote>. Similar epodes to stasima are   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Her. 815" valid="yes">Eur. <title>H. F.</title>815</bibl>—821, and  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

<p>The motive of the whole passage from 863 to 898 is the dramatic necessity of making an impressive preparation for the Nurse's <quote lang="greek">ῥῆσις</quote>. It rests with the Chorus alone to do this, since no actor is present.</p>
<p>Hermann supposed that, after the three leading choreutae had spoken (863 —870), each of the other twelve in turn took part in the dialogue. But this seems improbable.

<p><emph>869</emph> The MS. reading, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀήθης</lemma>, cannot be right. The word means either (1) ‘unusual,’ or (2) ‘unaccustomed’ to a thing. Here it has been taken in the first sense, as meaning, ‘with strange aspect,’ ‘unlike herself,’—<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, gloomy, instead of cheerful. It seems inconceivable that a classical writer should have so used <quote lang="greek">ἀήθης</quote>.</p>
<p>The conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀηδὴς</lemma> has been generally received; but this presents almost equal difficulties. As applied to persons, it regularly means, ‘disagreeable’;  <title>Eth.

Mor.</title> 2. 3 (p. 1200 <emph>a</emph> 15) <quote lang="greek">ὑπερόπτας καὶ ἀηδεῖς</quote>. Here it ought to mean, ‘of sad aspect’; it never occurs, however, in that sense. Hesychius has, indeed, <quote lang="greek">ἀηδές· στυγνὸν, λυπηρόν</quote>: but this paraphrase of the <emph>neuter</emph> proves nothing. In  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 82" valid="yes"> <title>O. T.</title>82</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἡδύς</quote> is not ‘joyous-looking,’ but ‘welcome.’</p>
<p>Surely <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀήθης</lemma> was merely a corruption of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀ</lemma>（<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γ</lemma>）<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ηθής</lemma>, which does not seem to occur, but which is as correct as <quote lang="greek">εὐγηθής</quote> or <quote lang="greek">πολυγηθής</quote>.—Cp.   <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

<p><emph>879</emph> The MS. reading, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σχετλιώτατα πρός γε πρᾶξιν</lemma>, has been variously altered (cr. n.), in order to avoid an anapaest in the 2nd foot, on the assumption that the verse is an iambic trimeter. The neatest of such corrections is Hermann's, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σχετλίῳ τὰ πρός γε πρᾶξιν</lemma>.</p>
<p>Heinrich Schmidt, whose view of the metre will be seen in the Metrical Analysis, merely transposes <quote lang="greek">πρός</quote> and <quote lang="greek">γε</quote>, writing <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σχετλιώτατά γε πρὸς πρᾶξιν</lemma>. Simplicity is not the only recommendation of this course; it transfers the stress of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γε</lemma> from <quote lang="greek">πρᾶξιν</quote> to the adverb. For this sense of <quote lang="greek">σχέτλιος</quote>, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 887" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>887</bibl>, and n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 47." valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>47.</bibl></p>
<p>By <quote lang="greek">πρᾶξιν</quote> must be meant here the mode of ‘doing’ the deed, rather than the victim's ‘fortune’; though the latter is the usual sense of the singular ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1305" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>1305</bibl> n.). After the question, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τίνι τρόπῳ</lemma>, a strong emphasis on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πρᾶξιν</lemma> would be, however, less natural. It might, indeed, be explained thus;—‘the <quote lang="greek">τρόπος</quote> of her death was the sword; but the mode of infliction (<quote lang="greek">πρᾶξις</quote>) rendered it peculiarly pitiable,’— since it was inflicted by her own hand.

They certainly state more precisely that the blow was dealt by her own hand (and not by a slave's); also that the deed had its origin from her own mind (<quote lang="greek">πρὸς αὑτῆς</quote>), and not from  any external influence. But it should also be recognised that, throughout this passage (871—898), the dramatic aim is to express profound horror and amazement. The messenger can hardly seize the full meaning of the questions; the hearers, on their part, find it hard to realise the answers.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κτίσαι</lemma> implies that the deed was momentous: schol. <quote lang="greek">κατασκευάσαι καὶ ποιῆσαι· καλῶς δὲ ὡς ἐπὶ μεγάλῳ τολμήματι εἶπεν τὴν λέξιν</quote>. When <quote lang="greek">κτίζειν</quote> is thus a tragic synonym for <quote lang="greek">ποιεῖν</quote>, there is usu. a predicative adj., as   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

<p>Hermann rejects this v. and the next, because the Chorus, not knowing the nature of the deeds (<quote lang="greek">οἷ) ἔδρασε</quote>), ought not yet to marvel at them. The verses were inserted, he thinks, to soften the abruptness of <quote lang="greek">ἐπεὶ παρῆλθε</quote> (900) after <quote lang="greek">κάρτ’ ἂν ᾤκτισας</quote> (897). It may be granted that they are not very forcible; but they seem genuine. The Nurse has hitherto been led from point to point by questions. A direct question (898) is needed to prompt her narrative. It would be less like her to begin it spontaneously.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἔνθα μή τις εἰσίδοι</lemma> would usu. mean, ‘in any place where no one beheld,’— oblique of <quote lang="greek">ἔνθ’ ἂν μή τις εἰσίδῃ</quote>. But here the sense is final; ‘where no one should behold.’ The normal Attic for this would be, <quote lang="greek">ἔνθα μή τις ὄψεται</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 800" valid="yes">cp. 800</bibl>),—not <quote lang="greek">ὄψοιτο</quote>, since, in a final relat. clause, the fut. indic. was usu. kept even after a secondary tense.</p>
<p>In Homeric Greek, a final relat. clause can take the subjunct. (usu. with <quote lang="greek">κε</quote>) after a primary tense, and the optat. (without <quote lang="greek">κε</quote>) after a secondary tense. But this is not an Attic construction. Thus the Homeric <quote lang="greek">ἄγγελον ἧκαν ὃς ἀγγείλειε</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 15.458" valid="yes"> <title>Od.</title>15. 458</bibl>) would in Attic be <quote lang="greek">ἄγγελον ἔπεμψαν ὃς ἀγγελεῖ</quote>: it could not be, <quote lang="greek">ὃς ἀγγείλειε</quote>. The constr. <quote lang="greek">ἔνθα μή τις εἰσίδοι</quote> —a very rare one in Attic—has grown out of the ‘deliberative’ constr. <quote lang="greek">οὐκ οἶδεν ἔνθα μή τις εἰσίδῃ</quote>, by steps which have changed the interrogative clause into a final relative clause. A like instance is  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 281" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>281</bibl><quote lang="greek">οὐχ ὅστις ἀρκέσειεν</quote>, (seeing no one) to aid. See Appendix.

Those words could certainly mean, ‘that she had become desolate,’— nor is the plaint less natural because death is so near. But the other reading is in truer harmony with the context, because she is saying <emph>farewell</emph> to the surroundings of happier days. Even inanimate objects move her tears at the thought of parting. Naturally the altars come first; when they were forsaken, the family life would have ceased.</p>

<p>The genuine verse must have had some direct reference to the context. She is weeping at the sight of attached servants whom she is about to leave. The general sense ought to be, ‘bewailing her own fate, and that of the household over which a change was impending’; since, when master and mistress were dead, the household would be dissolved, and the faithful slaves would pass into other hands. After the death of Heracles, Ceÿx, the king of Trachis (40 n.), was deterred by Eurystheus from continuing to protect the Heracleidae; who sought refuge at Athens.

<p>I believe that <quote lang="greek">ΑΠΑΙΔΑΣ</quote> arose from <quote lang="greek">ΕΠΑΛΛΟΙΣ</quote> when the E had been accidentally lost or obscured. A similar interchange of initial <quote lang="greek">α</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ε</quote>, combined with fusion of two words into one, occurs in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

El. 1097." valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>1097.</bibl>I incline to (1), because it seems unlikely that the poet should have <emph>preferred</emph> to make four consecutive words end in <quote lang="greek">ον</quote>. It is also worth noticing that <quote lang="greek">Δῖος</quote>, ‘belonging to Zeus,’ though used by  Aesch. and Eur. , is not extant in Soph. , who has only <quote lang="greek">δῖος</quote>, ‘divine’ or ‘godlike.’</p>

Trach. 135" valid="yes">cp. 135</bibl>): his arrival is close at hand. The schol.'s words, <quote lang="greek">μὴ παραχρῆμα ἀποθάνω θεασαμένη τὸν Ἡρακλέα κακῶς διακείμενον</quote>, have caused a surmise that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μοῦνον</lemma> has arisen from some word meaning ‘weak’ (see cr. n.). But there is little probability in  <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μῶλυν</lemma> (Hippônax fr. 60, perh. akin to <quote lang="greek">μαλακός</quote>), <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καῦρον</lemma> (a word which, acc. to Photius   <title>Lex.</title>p. 181. 14, Sophocles used in the sense of <quote lang="greek">κακός</quote>), <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μανὸν</lemma> (properly opposed to <quote lang="greek">πυκνόν</quote>), or <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαῦρον</lemma> (found only in grammarians).

The schol.'s <quote lang="greek">κακῶς διακείμενον</quote> may, however, be a mere comment; and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μοῦνον</lemma> seems well fitted to emphasise the terror of the sight.

<p> This passage consists of lyrics delivered by actors (<quote lang="greek">ἀπὸ σκηνῆς</quote>). As the Chorus takes no part in it, it is not technically a <quote lang="greek">κομμός</quote>, which is a <quote lang="greek">θρῆνος κοινὸς χοροῦ καὶ ἀπὸ σκηνῆς</quote>.</p>
<p>The lyric structure is complex, but not obscure. The passage falls into two main parts, separated by the five hexameters in 1018—1022 (<quote lang="greek">ὦ παῖ τοῦδ’ ἀνδρὸς...νέμει Ζεύς</quote>). I. The first part consists of 1004—1017, in which the first three verses correspond metrically with the last three. II. The second part consists of 1023—1043. (It is equal in length with the first part, though the traditional numbering makes it appear longer.) Here, the first four verses correspond with the last four. Then the central portion of part I. corresponds with the central portion of part II. Thus: (1) 1st strophe, 1004—1006,=1st antistr., 1015—1017. (2) 2nd str., 1007—1009,=2nd antistr., 1027—1030. (3) 3rd str., 1023—1026, =3rd antistr., 1040—1043. The dactyls in 1010—1014, and 1031—1040, could also be regarded as forming a fourth strophe and antistrophe.—For the metres see Metrical Analysis.

A restoration of this corrupt passage turns chiefly on the following points. (1) The corresponding verses of the antistrophe (1016 f.) may be taken as showing the true metre. (2) L's variant for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εὐνᾶσαι</lemma> in 1005, viz. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὕστατον</lemma>, may therefore be received. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">εὐνάσαι</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">α^</quote>), from <quote lang="greek">εὐνάζω</quote> is impossible, since, like <quote lang="greek">εὐνᾶσαι</quote> (<quote lang="greek">εὐνάω</quote>), it could only be transitive. (3) In 1006 the MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δύστανον</lemma> is clearly wrong; it may have been either a gloss on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δύσμορον</lemma>, or a corruption of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὕστατον</lemma>. (4) Hermann's reading in 1006, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐᾶθ’ ὕστατον εὐνᾶσθαι</lemma>, is strongly confirmed by the metrical correspondence with 1017, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μολὼν τοῦ στυγεροῦ; φεῦ φεῦ</lemma>,—a verse of undoubted soundness.

The correction of <quote lang="greek">ἔμπλεον</quote> (‘full’) to <quote lang="greek">ἐς πλέον</quote> is due to Meineke, and is confirmed by the following <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἢ</lemma> with the inf.: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>The MS. words, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοί τε γὰρ ὄμμα</lemma>, are unquestionably corrupt. This is shown by two things: (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὄμμα</lemma> is incongruous with the context; strength, not keenness of sight, is in question; and, even if it were suitable, it could not be reconciled with any probable emendation of the following words. (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τε</lemma> is unmeaning and impossible. I believe that I have found the solution by the slight change of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοί τε γὰρ ὄμμα</lemma> into <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοὶ γὰρ ἑτοίμα</lemma>. The corruption began by <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οίμα</lemma> passing into <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὄμμα</lemma>. How easy this would have been, may be judged from  <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

She was constantly represented in Greek art as present with Heracles during his labours, or as honouring and comforting him in seasons of repose. Sometimes she gives him a flower or a wreath; sometimes a refreshing draught. And, after the close of his mortal toils, it is Athena Nikè who escorts him to Olympus. (Cp. n. on  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 728." valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title>728.</bibl>) The art-literature of the subject will be found in Roscher,  <title>Lex.</title>, p. 2215. Attic black-figure vases often illustrate this relationship,—one which was the more welcome to Athenians because Heracles was essentially a Dorian hero.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1046</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὦ πολλὰ δὴ</lemma> <quote lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</quote> This speech, down to v. 1102, is translated by Cicero in  <bibl default="NO" n="Cic. Tusc. 2. 8" valid="yes"> <title>Tusc.</title>2. 8</bibl>, where the fact that the poets recognise pain as an evil is illustrated by the laments of Philoctetes, Heracles and Prometheus.</p>
<p>Cicero's version is essentially that of an orator; the true test for it would be declamation. But even a reader can feel its sonorous vigour, and its Roman gravity; Cicero succeeds as Lord Derby succeeded in much of the <title>Iliad.</title> The rendering of the Greek is very free, sometimes inadequate, but always manly, and highly terse; indeed, the 57 lines of the original become 45; in one place, eleven verses (1079—1089) are reduced to four (vv. 30—33).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θερμὰ</lemma>: <quote lang="greek">θερμός</quote> was said (1) of a hot or rash temperament ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 88" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>88</bibl>): (2) of a rash deed, as in  <title>Plut</title> 415 <quote lang="greek">ὦ θερμὸν ἔργον κἀνόσιον καὶ παράνομον</quote> | <quote lang="greek">τολμῶντε δρᾶν</quote>. Here <quote lang="greek">θερμὰ</quote> is not ‘rash,’ but expresses intense conflict with deadly peril; as we speak of ‘a hot fight.’</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κοὐ λόγῳ κακὰ</lemma> fitly follows <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θερμά</lemma>, the word which recalls the moment of dire stress. His trials had been fiery, and grievous, not in report or name alone.  No <quote lang="greek">λόγος</quote> could express to others what the <quote lang="greek">ἔργα</quote> had been to the doer. In  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 761" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>761</bibl> ff. a similar antithesis is implied: <quote lang="greek">τοιαῦτά σοι ταῦτ’ ἐστίν, ὡς μὲν ἐν λόγῳ</quote> | <quote lang="greek">ἀλγεινά, τοῖς δ’ ἰδοῦσιν, οἵπερ εἴδομεν</quote>, | <quote lang="greek">μέγιστα πάντων ὧν ὄπωπ’ ἐγὼ κακῶν</quote>: grievous enough to hear; but far worse to see. For <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὐ λόγῳ</lemma>, cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 813" valid="yes"> <title>Ai.</title>813</bibl><quote lang="greek">κοὐ λόγῳ δείξω μόνον</quote>:  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1453" valid="yes"> <title>El.</title>1453</bibl><quote lang="greek">κἀπέδειξεν οὐ λόγῳ μόνον</quote>.  <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc.  6. 18" valid="yes">Thuc.6. 18</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀμύνεσθαι οὐ λόγῳ ἀλλ’ ἔργῳ μᾶλλον</quote>.</p>
<p>The MS. reading, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καὶ λόγῳ κακὰ</lemma>, is certainly wrong, for two reasons. (1) When the required sense is, ‘grievous to tell,’ <quote lang="greek">κακά</quote> becomes, for Greek poetical idiom, too weak; we need such a word as <quote lang="greek">δεινά</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἀλγεινά</quote>. This objection does not apply to a phrase of ironical form, such as <quote lang="greek">οὐ λόγῳ κακά</quote>. (2) Idiom would require <quote lang="greek">καὶ λέγειν</quote> rather than <quote lang="greek">καὶ λόγῳ</quote>. Cicero, no doubt, read <quote lang="greek">καὶ λόγῳ</quote> (‘<title>O multa</title> dictu gravia, <emph>perpessu aspera</emph>’); but that proves nothing. In  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 4" valid="yes"> <title>Ant.</title>4</bibl><quote lang="greek">οὔτ’ ἄτης ἄτερ</quote> was the only reading known to Didymus (<emph>c.</emph> 30 B.C.).

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στρατὸς Γιγάντων</lemma>: after sacking Troy, and ravaging Cos, Heracles went  to Phlegra (sometimes identified with Pallenè, the westernmost headland of the Chalcidic peninsula), and helped the gods to vanquish their Earth-born foes.

<p>Cicero represents this passage by a single verse, <title>Iam cernam</title>, <emph>mene an illam potiorem putes.</emph> Hence Nauck rejects v. 1069. But the inference is most unsafe, as another instance will show. The passage beginning with <quote lang="greek">ἰδού</quote> (1079) and ending with <quote lang="greek">ἐξώρμηκεν</quote> (1089) shrinks, in Cicero's version, to three lines and a half, viz., <title>Videte cuncti: tuque</title>, <emph>caelestum sator</emph>, | <title>Iace</title>, <emph>obsecro</emph>, <emph>in me vim coruscam fulminis!</emph> | <title>Nunc</title>, <emph>nunc dolorum anxiferi torquent vertices:</emph> | <title>Nunc serpit ardor.</title> Thus Cicero wholly ignores vv. 1085 ff.: he ignores vv. 1080—1084 also, except in so far as their general sense is blended with his version of 1088 f., <quote lang="greek">δαίνυται...ἐξώρμηκεν</quote>. Yet the Greek text there is clearly sound.

Its formation from <quote lang="greek">στέργ‐ω</quote> is anomalous, since the word ought to be <quote lang="greek">στέργμα</quote>: but the same may be said of <quote lang="greek">στέργηθρον</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">στέρκτρον</quote>): and <quote lang="greek">θέλγητρον</quote> was in use along with <quote lang="greek">θέλκτρον</quote>. [Lidd. and Scott cite <quote lang="greek">θέλγημα</quote> from Suidas <emph>s.v.</emph> <quote lang="greek">βουκ&lt;*&gt;λήσας</quote>: but Bernhardy (ed. 1853, vol. I. p. 1017) reads  <quote lang="greek">θέλγητρον</quote> there, without noting a variant.] The objection to <quote lang="greek">στέργημα</quote> from the <emph>form</emph> is not, then, decisive. As to <emph>sense</emph>, <quote lang="greek">στέργηθρον</quote>, like <quote lang="greek">φίλτρον</quote>, is ‘an instrument for producing love’; while <quote lang="greek">στέργημα</quote>, like <quote lang="greek">φίλημα</quote>, ought to denote an effect. But here, again, we must allow for the freedom of poetical diction. The analogy of <quote lang="greek">κήλημα</quote>, ‘a spell’ (  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Tro. 893" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Tro.</title>893</bibl>), by the side of <quote lang="greek">κήληθρον</quote> (Bek ker <title>Anecd.</title> p. 46. 25), is not a strict one, since <quote lang="greek">κήλημα</quote> is properly, ‘an effect of charming’; still, such an analogy may have influenced a poet who found <quote lang="greek">στέργημα</quote> more convenient than <quote lang="greek">στέργηθρον</quote>. Hyllus presently refers to this charm as <quote lang="greek">τοιῷδε φίλτρῳ</quote> (1142): which rather suggests that a word in the sing. number was used here also. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 575" valid="yes">Cp. 575</bibl> <quote lang="greek">κηλητήριον</quote>: 685 <quote lang="greek">φάρμακον</quote>. (In 584 f. the plurals <quote lang="greek">φίλτροις, θέλκτροισι</quote> describe the <emph>class</emph> of remedy: they do not directly denote the unguent.) For these reasons I refrain from changing <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στέργημα</lemma>, with Nauck, to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στέργηθρα</lemma>.

The position of the clause, <quote lang="greek">ὡς προσεῖδε τοὺς ἔνδον γάμους</quote>, which would properly precede <quote lang="greek">ἀπήμπλακε</quote>, is made possible by the strong emphasis on <quote lang="greek">στέργημα...δοκοῦσα προσβαλεῖν</quote>: ‘It was a love-charm that she thought to apply (though she failed), when she saw,’ etc. The leading idea of the sentence is here expressed by the participial clause (592 n.).</p>

Trach. 802" valid="yes">cp. 802</bibl>: 1001: 1111). Why, then, should he now speak as if he realised his state for the first time? The answer seems to be that, though the ultimate prospect is unchanged, his doom acquires a new terror in the light of its supernatural source. Hitherto he has believed himself the victim of human malice: it might leave no hope, but still it fixed no term. Now he knows that he is in the grip of <quote lang="greek">ἀνάγκη</quote>: his moments are numbered. Henceforth he thinks only of the end.

<p>Sophocles glances here at parts of the story which do not come within the scope of the play. Alcmena, daughter of Electryon king of Mycenae, had been betrothed to her first cousin, Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus king of Tiryns. Amphitryon accidentally killed his uncle, Electryon, and then fled from Tiryns to Thebes with his betrothed. At Thebes Alcmena bore Heracles to Zeus. Heracles afterwards went to Argolis and served Eurystheus,—with the hope that his toils would purchase a return to Tiryns for the exiled Amphitryon and Alcmena (  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Her. 19" valid="yes">Eur. <title>H. F.</title>19</bibl>). When these toils were over, Heracles dwelt in freedom at Tiryns with his family, including Alcmena,—Amphitryon being dead ( <bibl default="NO" n="Diod. 4. 33" valid="yes">Diod.4. 33</bibl>). He  afterwards slew Iphitus, and then sought a refuge for his household at Trachis (39). But, in the course of the fifteen months since he departed for Lydia, Alcmena had returned to Tiryns, (Eurystheus having no cause to fear the aged widow,)—and had taken some of her grandchildren with her, in order to lighten the burden on the hospitality of Ceÿx.— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ξυλλαβοῦς)</lemma>, here simply=<quote lang="greek">λαβοῦσα μεθ’ ἑαυτῆς</quote>: cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p>The name <quote lang="greek">Σελλοί</quote>, or <quote lang="greek">Ἑλλοί</quote> (akin to <quote lang="greek">Ἕλλην, Ἑλλάς</quote>), denoted a prehistoric tribe, dwelling at and around Dodona: see Appendix, § 4.

Here, as in 171 f., the poet says that the oak <emph>gave</emph> the oracle; but he does not here mention the expositors.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀρείων</lemma> refers to the site of Dodona in a valley, more than 1600 feet above sea-level, surrounded by hills. See Appendix, § 1.</p>

<p>Throughout the dialogue (1114—1156), Hyllus has been gentle and respectful.

The same objection applies to conjecturing <quote lang="greek">ἐπελθεῖν</quote> (‘I am afraid of being drawn into such a strife’).

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">δάμαρτα</lemma>. This passage concerning Iolè and Hyllus (1216—1251) was rendered indispensable by the plot, if the poet was to avoid a contradiction which must otherwise have perplexed the spectators.</p>
<p>Iolè figured in legend as the wife of Hyllus. Their son, <quote lang="greek">Κλεοδαῖος</quote> (called <quote lang="greek">Κλεοδάτης</quote> by Theopompus, fr. 30), was mentioned by Hesiod (schol. <bibl default="NO" n="Apollon. 1.824" valid="yes">Ap. Rh. 1. 824</bibl>), and was recorded in the pedigree of the Spartan kings, being the grandfather of Aristodemus ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 6. 52" valid="yes">Her.6. 52</bibl><bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 8. 131" valid="yes">Her., 8. 131</bibl>). Hyllus and Iolè had also a daughter, <quote lang="greek">Εὐαίχμη</quote>, known in Messenian story ( <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 4. 2. 1" valid="yes">Paus.4. 2. 1</bibl>).</p>
<p>But, in this play, Iolè is the paramour of Heracles, and indirectly the cause of his death. How, then, could Hyllus wed her? His own words (1233—1237) express what a Greek would feel. It was necessary, then, that the marriage should be imposed upon him by his dying father's inexorable command.</p>
<p>Cp. Apollodorus 2. 7. 7 § 13 <quote lang="greek">ἐντειλάμενος Ὕλλῳ...τὴν Ἰόλην ἀνδρωθέντα γῆμαι</quote>: as if Hyllus were younger than Sophocles here imagines him. Ovid,  <bibl default="NO" n="Ov. Met. 9. 278" valid="yes"> <title>Met.</title>9. 278</bibl>, of Iolè: <quote lang="la">Herculis illam | Imperiis thalamoque animoque receperat Hyllus.</quote>  Acc. to Pherecydes, it was for Hyllus, not for himself, that Heracles had first asked the hand of Iolè (schol. on v. 354).

<p>Other views are:—(1) <quote lang="greek">ἀνακινῆσαι</quote> is intrans., ‘be roused.’ But this use is unexampled, and cannot safely be inferred from the intrans. <quote lang="greek">ὑποκινεῖν</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 5. 106" valid="yes">Her.5. 106</bibl>, etc.), or <quote lang="greek">παρακινεῖν</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">παρακόπτειν, παραπαίειν</quote>, <emph>delirare.</emph> (2) The subject to the inf. is <quote lang="greek">νόσον</quote>, and the object is <quote lang="greek">σε</quote> understood.

<p>I take the words in a way different from any of these. <quote lang="greek">χάλυβος στόμιον</quote>, the ‘curb of steel,’ is, as all agree, the strong selfrestraint which is to keep the lips <emph>closed.</emph> Then <quote lang="greek">λιθοκόλλητον</quote> introduces a new image. The lips, thus firmly closed, are <emph>set as stone to stone</emph> in masonry. Thus the whole phrase means ‘A curb of steel, to keep the lips set as stone to stone.’ The use of <quote lang="greek">λιθοκόλλητον</quote> to describe the <emph>effect</emph> of the ‘curb’ has been assisted by the suggestion, in <quote lang="greek">στόμιον</quote>, of <quote lang="greek">στόμα</quote>.</p>

<p> The unanimous tradition assigned verses 1264—1274 to Hyllus. Verses 1275—1278 were given by some to the Chorus, and by others to Hyllus. From the indication in L at v. 1275 (<quote lang="greek">χορὸς γράφεται ὕλλος</quote>), and from the schol. there (<quote lang="greek">χορός· τινὲς ὕλλος</quote>), it may be conjectured that the attribution of 1275—1278 to the Chorus was the prevalent one. This was only natural, as the Chorus usually closes the play. A majority of modern editors, however, give vv. 1264—1278 wholly to Hyllus; and they seem right.—See Appendix.

<p> These four verses are addressed by Hyllus to the leader of the Chorus, and give the signal for moving from the orchestra. With <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παρθέν)</lemma>, compare <quote lang="greek">ὦ παρθένοι</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 211" valid="yes">211</bibl>. The Chorus has been silent since <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1113" valid="yes">1113</bibl>; and it seems dramatically right that its silence should be maintained in this last scene. The young maidens of Trachis may well leave  the son of Heracles, at this solemn moment, to sum up the lesson of his father's fate.</p>
<p>If the verses are given to the leader of the Chorus, then <quote lang="greek">παρθέν)</quote> will be taken in a collective sense, as referring to the other choreutae; <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 821" valid="yes">cp. 821</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὦ παῖδες</quote>. Prof. Campbell understands a reference to the maidens of the <emph>household</emph> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 205" valid="yes">(205)</bibl>; but this seems less natural. In either case, the singular number would be unusual.</p>
<p>Another view is that <quote lang="greek">παρθέν)</quote> means Iolè. But she is not present: and, even if she could be thus summoned forth, her presence would be unfitting.
