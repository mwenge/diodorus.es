<span class="line-ref">Line 1</span><p>The <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> is concerned with the fall of the Theban king; the <title>Coloneus</title>, with the close of his life; and the <title>Antigone</title>, with a later episode in the fortunes of his children. But the order of composition was, <title>Antigone</title>, <title>Tyrannus</title>, <title>Coloneus;</title> and the first was separated from the last by perhaps more than thirty years of the poet's life. The priority of the <title>Antigone</title> admits of a probable explanation, which is not without interest. There is some ground for thinking that the subject—though not the treatment—was suggested by Aeschylus.</p>
<p>The sisters Antigone and Ismene are not mentioned by<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Earliest trace of the story.</note> Homer, Hesiod, or Pindar<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Salustius, in his Argument to this play (p. 5), notices that the fortunes of the sisters were differently related by other writers. Mimnermus (<date authname="-620" value="-620">c. 620 B.C.</date>) spoke of Ismene having been slain at Thebes by Tydeus, one of the Argive chiefs.  Ion of Chios (<date authname="-450" value="-450">c. 450 B.C.</date>) said that both sisters were burned in the Theban temple of Hera by Laodamas, son of Eteocles, when Thebes was taken in the later war of the Epigoni. Here, then, we have an Ionian contemporary of Sophocles who did not know the legend of Antigone's deed,—another indication that the legend was of Attic growth.</note>. Antigone's heroism presupposes a legend that burial had been refused to Polyneices. Pindar knows nothing of such a refusal. He speaks of the seven funeral pyres provided at Thebes for the seven divisions of the Argive army<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Pind. O. 6" valid="yes">Pind. <title>Ol.</title> 6.15</bibl>; <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. N. 9" valid="yes"><title>Nem.</title> 9. 24</bibl>.</note>. Similarly Pausanias records a Theban legend that the corpse of Polyneices was burned on the same pyre with that of Eteocles, and that the very flames refused to mingle<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 9.18.3" valid="yes">Paus. 9.18.3</bibl>.</note>. The refusal of burial was evidently an Attic addition to the story.  It served to contrast Theban vindictiveness with Athenian humanity; for it was Theseus who ultimately buried the Argives at Eleusis. If Creon's edict, then, was an Attic invention, it may be conjectured that Antigone's resolve to defy the edict was also the conception of an Attic poet. Aeschylus is the carliest author who refers to the edict against burial, and he is also the first who tells of Antigone's resolve. His Theban trilogy consisted of the <title>Laïus</title>, the <title>Oedipus</title>, and the <title>Seven against Thebes</title><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">With regard to this trilogy, see Introd. to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, p. xvi.</note>. At the end of the last play a herald proclaims an edict just published by the Council of Thebes; sepulture shall be given to Eteocles, but denied to Polyneices. Antigone at once declares her resolve; she will bury Polyneices. The Theban maidens who form the Chorus are divided. One half of their number goes to attend the funeral of Eteocles; the other half accompanies Antigone to her task. There the play ends.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1</span><p>In this play, as in the others, the editor has used the Autotype<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Laurentian MS (L).</note> Facsimile of L (published by the London Hellenic Society in <date authname="1885" value="1885">1885</date>); and, with its aid, has endeavoured to render the report of that manuscript as complete and exact as possible. In some instances, where discrepancies existed between previous collations, the facsimile has served to resolve the doubt; in a few other cases, it has availed to correct errors which had obtained general currency: the critical notes on 311, 375, 770, 1098, 1280 will supply examples.</p>
<p>The MSS., besides L, to which reference is made, are:—A (13th<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Other MSS.</note> cent.), E (ascribed to 13th cent., but perhaps of the 14th), T (15th cent.), V (late 13th or early 14th), V2 (probably 14th), with the following 14th century MSS.,—V3, V4,  Vat.,   Vat.b, L2, R. Some account of these has been given in the Introduction to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus;</title> cp. also the Introd. to the <title>Oed. Col.</title> p. xlix. A few references are also made to an Augsburg MS. (Aug. b, 14th cent.), to Dresd. a (cod. 183, 14th cent.), and to M4 (Milan, Ambrosian Library, cod. C. 24 sup., 15th cent.). The symbol ‘r’ is occasionally used in the critical notes to denote ‘one or more of the MSS. other than L’. The advantages of such a symbol are twofold: (1) the note can often be made shorter and simpler; (2) the paramount importance of L is thus more clearly marked, and, so far, the relative values of the documents are presented to the reader in a truer perspective. But this symbol has been employed only in those cases where no reason existed for a more particular statement.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ΑΡΙΣΤΟΦΑΝΟΥΣ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΚΟΥ</lemma> Aristophanes of Byzantium, librarian at Alexandria (flor. 200 B.C.), to whom the metrical argument for the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> is also ascribed in the MSS., but incorrectly: see <title>Oed. Tyr.</title> p. 4. Though the genuineness of this prose <quote lang="greek">ὑποθέσις</quote> has not such a <foreign lang="la">prima facie</foreign> case against it as exists against that of all the metrical arguments ascribed to Aristophanes, it must at least be regarded as very doubtful. If the perfect <quote lang="greek">ἀνῄρηται</quote> in line 2 is sound, it is an indication of much later age, as has been shown in the critical note above. Another such indication, I think, is the phrase <quote lang="greek">εἰς μνημεῖον κατάγειον ἐντεθεῖσα παρὰ</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">ὑπὸ</quote>) <quote lang="greek">τοῦ Κρέοντος</quote> (l. 2),—a later (and modern) use of the prep. which does not surprise us in Salustius (<ref targOrder="U" target="hyp2">Arg. II.</ref> l. 11 <quote lang="greek">παρὰ τοῦ Κρέοντος κωλύεται</quote>), but which would be strange in the Alexandrian scholar of <date authname="-200" value="-200"><foreign lang="la">circ.</foreign> 200 B.C.</date> In the Laurentian MS. this Argument precedes, while the other two follow, the play.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐν Ἀντιγόνῃ</lemma> Only some 21 small fragments remain (about 80 verses in all), and these throw no light on the details of the plot.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν Μαίονα</lemma>. This reading is made almost certain by the mention of ‘Maion, son of Haemon’ in <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 4.394" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 4.394</bibl>, coupled with the fact that L has <quote lang="greek">Μαίμονα</quote> in the margin (see cr. n.). But the reading <quote lang="greek">μετὰ τοῦ Αἵμονος</quote> just before is doubtful. If it is sound, then we must understand: ‘having been discovered in company with Haemon, she was given in marriage (to him).’ But I am strongly inclined to think that the conjecture <quote lang="greek">μετὰ τοῦτο τῷ Αἵμονι</quote> (which would explain the <foreign lang="la">v.l.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">τῷ Αἵμονι</quote>) is right. Dindorf differs from other interpreters in supposing that it was not Haemon, but someone else—perhaps a nameless <quote lang="greek">αὐτουργός,</quote> as in the case of the Euripidean Electra—to whom Euripides married Antigone: and he reads <quote lang="greek">τίκτει τὸν Αἵμονα</quote>. We have then to suppose that Antigone marked her affection for her lost lover by giving his name to her son by the <quote lang="greek">αὐτουργός</quote>. At the end of the scholia in L we find these words:—<quote lang="greek">Ὅτι διαφέρει τῆς Εὐριπίδου Ἀντιγόνης αὕτη, ὅτι φωραθεῖσα ἐκείνη διὰ τὸν Αἵμονος ἔρωτα ἐξεδόθη πρὸς γάμον· ἐνταῦθα δὲ τοὐναντίον</quote>. The contrast meant is between her marriage in Euripides and her death in Sophocles: but the words obviously leave it doubtful whether the person to whom Euripides married her was Haemon or not.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῆς ἐν Σάμῳ στρατηγίας</lemma> The traditional <quote lang="greek">στρατηγία</quote> of Sophocles, and its relation to the production of the <title>Antigone</title>, are discussed in the Introduction.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 2</span><p>The situation, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Aeschylean situation—contrast with the Sophoclean.</note> as it is thus left by the <title>Seven against Thebes</title>, is essentially different from that in the play of Sophocles. The Antigone of Aeschylus is not isolated in her action, but is escorted by a band of maidens who publicly avow their sympathy. Though the herald enters a formal protest, and hints that the rulers are likely to be ‘severe,’ yet he does not say that death is to be the price of disobedience, nor, indeed, does he specify any penalty. The Chorus represents average civic opinion; and one half of the Chorus openly defies the decree. A plot which began thus could scarcely end in the Council taking the heroine's life. It rather foreshadows a final solution which shall be favourable to her; and we might surmise that, in loosing the knot, Aeschylus would have resorted to a divine mandate or intervention. But the Antigone of Sophocles stands alone; the penalty of a dreadful death is definitely set before her; and, whatever the Thebans may think of Creon's edict, no one dares to utter a word of disapproval. Taking the two primary facts—the veto, and Antigone's resolve— Sophocles has worked in a manner which is characteristically his own.

<span class="line-ref">Line 3</span><p>Let us first trace the outline of the action.<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play. I. Prologue: 1-99.</note>  The scene is laid before the palace of Creon,—once that of Oedipus,—at Thebes. The city has just been delivered from a great peril. It had been besieged by an Argive army, the allies of the exile Polyneices, whom his brother Eteocles had driven out of Thebes, that he himself might be sole king. But on the day before that with which the play begins, the two brothers had slain each other in single fight. Besides Polyneices, six other leaders of the besiegers had been killed by as many Theban chiefs. Thus deprived of its commanders, the besieging host had fled, panic-stricken, in the night.</p>
<p>It is the moment of dawn. Antigone has asked her sister Ismene to come forth with her from the house, in order that they may converse alone. Creon, their uncle, is now king. He has put forth an edict,—that Eteocles, the champion of Thebes, shall be honourably buried; but the body of Polyneices, the country's foe, shall be left on the plain outside the walls of Thebes, for dogs and birds to mangle at their will. If any citizen dares to disobey, he shall be stoned to death. Antigone tells her sister that she is resolved to defy this edict, and to bury their brother Polyneices. Ismene vainly seeks to dissuade her; and Antigone goes forth, alone, to do the deed.</p>
<p>The Chorus of fifteen Theban elders now enters. Creon has<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 100-161.</note> summoned them to meet him,—they do not yet know wherefore. They greet the rising sun, and, in a splendid ode, describe the danger from which Thebes has been saved. The dramatic effect of the ode is to make us feel how grievous, from a Theban point of view, has been the act of Polyneices.</p>
<p>Creon comes forth. Declaring his resolve that patriotism and<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 162-331.</note> treason shall never miss their due rewards, he acquaints the Chorus with the purport of his edict,—that Eteocles shall be honoured, and Polyneices dishonoured. The elders receive the decision with unquestioning respect; though their words are more suggestive of acquiescence than of approval.</p>
<p>A guard arrives, with the startling news that unknown hands have already paid burial rites to Polyneices, by the symbolical act of sprinkling dust on the corpse. Creon dismisses the man with threats of a terrible death, which the other guards shall share, if they fail to discover the men who have thus broken the edict.</p>
<p>The choral ode which follows <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon: 332-375. Anapaests, 376-383.</note> is a beautiful treatment of a theme which this mysterious deed suggests,—human inventiveness,—its audacity and its almost infinite resource, save for the limits set by fate. As these strains cease, anapaests spoken by the leader of the Chorus express sudden amazement and pain.—Antigone, the royal maiden, the niece of the king, is led in, a prisoner, in the hands of the guard.</p>
<p>Questioned by Creon, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 384-581.</note>Antigone replies that she knew the edict, but nevertheless paid funeral rites to her brother because she held that no human law could supersede the higher law of the gods. She is ready to die.</p>
<p>Creon, still more incensed by her demeanour, vows that she shall indeed perish by a shameful death. He suspects Ismene also; and she is presently brought in. Agonised by grief for her sister's impending doom, Ismene entreats that she may be considered as sharing the responsibility of the deed; she wishes to die with her sister. Antigone firmly and even sternly, though not bitterly, rejects this claim, which ‘justice will not allow’; the deed has been hers only. Ismene vainly seeks to move Creon; he is not touched by her despair, or by the thought—to which Ismene also appeals—that his son Haemon is betrothed to Antigone. He orders that both sisters shall be taken into the house, and closely guarded; for his present purpose is that both shall die.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon: 582-625. Anapaests, 626-630.</note>Moved by the sentence which has just been passed, the Chorus speaks of the destiny which has pursued the royal line of Thebes: ‘When a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore.’ The sisters were the last hope of the race; and now they too must perish. The ode closes with a strain of general reflection on the power of Zeus and the impotence of human self-will. There is no conscious reference to Creon; but, for the spectators, the words are suggestive and ominous.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 631-780.</note>Haemon enters. He has come to plead with his father for the life of his betrothed Antigone. This scene is one of the finest in the play. A lesser dramatist would have been apt to depict Haemon as passionately agitated. The Haemon of Sophocles maintains an entire calm and self-control so long as a ray of hope remains; his pleading is faultless in tone and in tact; he knows Creon, and he does not intercede with him as a lover for his betrothed; he speaks as a son solicitous for his father's reputation, and as a subject concerned for the authority of his king; he keeps his temper under stinging taunts; it is only when Creon is found to be inexorable that the pent-up fire at last flashes out. Then, when Haemon rushes forth,—resolved, as his latest words hint, not to survive his beloved,—he leaves with the spectators a profound sense of the supreme effort which he has made in a cause dearer to him than life, and has made without success.</p>
<p>Haemon having quitted the scene, Creon announces, in reply to a question of the Chorus, the mode of death which he designs for Antigone. As for Ismene, he will spare her; her entire innocence has been proved, to his calmer thoughts, by the words which passed between the sisters in his presence. Antigone is to be immured in a sepulchral chamber,—one of the rock-tombs in the low hills that fringe the plain of Thebes,—and there she is to be left, with only the formal dole of food which religion prescribes, in order to avert the pollution which the State would otherwise incur through the infliction of death by starvation.</p>
<p>A choral song celebrates the power of Love,—as seen in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon: 781-800. Anapaests 801-805.</note> Haemon, who has not feared to confront a father's anger in pleading for one who has broken the law. While implying that Haemon has acted amiss, the ode also palliates his action by suggesting that the deity who swayed him is irresistible. At the same time this reference to Haemon's passion serves to deepen the pathos of Antigone's fate.</p>
<p>She is now brought out of the house by Creon's servants,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode: 806-943.</note> who are to conduct her to her living tomb. At that sight, the Theban elders cry that pity constrains them, even as love constrained Haemon, to deplore the sentence. Antigone speaks to them of her fate, and they answer not unkindly; yet they say plainly that the blame for her doom rests with herself alone; the king could not grant impunity to a breach of his edict. Creon enters, and reproves the guards for their delay. In her latest words, Antigone expresses her confidence in the love which awaits her beyond the grave; and also the trouble which overclouds her trust in the gods, who knew her deed, and yet have permitted her to suffer this doom. Then she is led forth, and is seen no more.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon: 944-987.</note>The rocky tomb to which she is passing suggests the theme of a choral ode, commemorating three other sufferers of a cruel imprisonment,—Danaë, Lycurgus, and Cleopatra.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Fifth episode: 988-1114.</note>As the choral strains cease, the blind and aged prophet Teiresias is led in by a boy. He comes with an urgent warning for the king. The gods are wroth with Thebes; they will no longer give their prophet any sign by the voice of birds, or through the omens of sacrifice. The king is himself the cause, by his edict. Carrion-creatures have defiled the altars of Thebes with the taint of the unburied dead. Let burial rites be at once paid to Polyneices. He speaks for Creon's own good.</p>
<p>Here we pause for a moment to answer a question which naturally occurs to the modern reader. Why is Polyneices said to be still unburied? Has not Antigone already rendered burial rites to him; is it not precisely for that action that she is dying? Antigone had, indeed, given symbolical sepulture to Polyneices by sprinkling dust upon the corpse, and pouring libations. The performance of that act discharged her personal duty towards the dead and the gods below; it also saved her dead brother from the dishonour (which would else have been a reproach to him in the other world) of having been neglected by his nearest kinsfolk on earth. But Antigone's act did not clear Creon. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was still unperformed. So far as Creon was concerned, Polyneices was still unburied. And Creon's obligation could not be discharged, as Antigone's had been, merely by the symbolical act, which religion accepted only when a person was unavoidably hindered from performing regular rites. There was nothing to hinder Creon from performing such rites. These were still claimed from him. After Antigone's tribute had been rendered, birds and dogs had been busy with the corpse. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was now also a duty towards the polluted State, from which his impiety had alienated the gods above.</p>
<p>In reply to the friendly and earnest warning of Teiresias, Creon angrily accuses the seer of mercenary complicity in a disloyal plot; malcontent Thebans wish to gain a triumph over their king by frightening him into a surrender. Never will be grant burial rites to Polyneices.</p>
<p>Teiresias, angered in his turn, then declares the penalty which the gods reserve for such obduracy. With the life of his own son shall Creon atone for his twofold sin,—the detention of the dead among the living, and the imprisonment of the living in the abode of the dead. The seer then departs.</p>
<p>Creon is deeply moved. In the course of long and eventful years he has learned a lesson which is present also to the minds of the Theban elders. The word of Teiresias has never failed to come true.</p>
<p>After a hurried consultation with the Chorus, Creon's resolve is taken. He will yield. He immediately starts, with his servants, for the upper part of the Theban plain, where the body of Polyneices is still lying,—not very far, it would seem, from the place of Antigone's prison.</p>
<p>At this point an objection might suggest itself to the spectator. Is there not something a little improbable in the celerity with which Creon,—hitherto inflexible,—is converted by the threats of a seer whom he has just been denouncing as a venal impostor? Granting that experience had attested the seer's infallibility when speaking in the name of the gods, has not Creon professed to believe that, in this instance, Teiresias is merely the mouthpiece of disloyal Thebans? The answer will be found by attentively observing the state of mind which, up to this point, has been portrayed in Creon. He has, indeed, been inflexible; he has even been vehement in asserting his inflexibility. But, under this vehemence, we have been permitted to see occasional glimpses of an uneasy conscience. One such glimpse is at <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 889" valid="yes">vv. 889 f.</bibl>, where he protests that <emph>his</emph> hands are clean in regard to Antigone;—he had given her full warning, and he has not shed her blood,—‘but at any rate’ (<quote lang="greek">δ’ οὖν</quote>,—i.e., wherever the guilt rests)—‘she shall die.’ Another such trait occurs at <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1040" valid="yes">v. 1040</bibl>, where he says that he will not bury Polyneices, though the throne of Zeus in heaven should be defiled,—quickly adding, ‘for I know that no mortal can pollute the gods.’<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See note <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1044">on v. 1044</ref>.</note> It may further be remarked that a latent self-mistrust is suggested by the very violence of his rejoinder to the Chorus, when they venture, with timid respect, to hint the possibility that some divine agency may have been at work in the mysterious tribute paid to Polyneices (278 f.). A like remark applies to the fury which breaks out at moments in his interviews with Haemon and with Teiresias. The delicacy of the dramatic tact which forbids these touches to be obtrusive is such as Sophocles, alone of the Attic masters, knew how to use. But they suffice to indicate the secret trembling of the balance behind those protestations of an unconquerable resolve; the terrible prophecy of Teiresias only turns the scale.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Hyporcheme (taking the place of the fifth stasimon): 1115-1154.</note>The Chorus is now gladdened by the hope that Creon's repentance, late though it is, may avail to avert the doom threatened by Teiresias. This feeling is expressed in a short and joyous ode, which invokes the bright presence of Dionysus. May the joyous god come with healing virtue to his favourite Thebes! The substitution of this lively dance-song (‘hyporcheme’) for a choral ode of a graver cast here serves the same purpose of contrast as in the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, the <title>Ajax</title>, and the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The catastrophe is approaching<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See note <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1115">on v. 1115</ref>.</note>.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VII. Exodos: 1155-1352.</note>A Messenger now enters,—one of the servants who had accompanied Creon to the plain. The words in which he briefly intimates the nature of his tidings (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1173" valid="yes">v. 1173</bibl>) are overheard, within the house, by Eurydicè, then in the act of going forth with offerings to Pallas; and she swoons. On recovering consciousness, she comes forth, and hears the full account from the Messenger. He says that, when they reached the plain, Creon's first care was for the funeral rites due to Polyneices. After prayer to Pluto and Hecatè, the remains—lacerated by birds and dogs— were washed, and solemnly burned; a high funeral-mound was then raised on the spot. Creon and his followers then repaired to the tomb of Antigone. They found her already dead; she had used her veil to hang herself. Haemon, in a frenzied state, was embracing her corpse. He drew his sword upon his father, who fled. Then, in a swift agony of remorse, the son slew himself.</p>
<p>Having heard this news, Eurydicè silently retires into the house.</p>
<p>She has hardly withdrawn, when Creon enters, with attendants, carrying Haemon's shrouded corpse<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">i.e., an effigy. The deuteragonist, who had acted Haemon, had been on the stage, as Messenger, up to v. 1256, and had still to come on as Second Messenger at <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1278" valid="yes">v. 1278</bibl>.</note> upon a bier. He bewails his own folly as the cause of his son's death. Amid his laments, a Messenger from the house announces that Eurydicè has stabbed herself at the household altar, with imprecations on the husband. Wholly desolate and wretched, Creon prays for death; nor has the Chorus any gentler comfort for him than the stern precept of resignation,—‘Pray thou no more; mortals have no escape from destined woe.’ As he is conducted into the house, the closing words of the drama are spoken by the leader of the Chorus: ‘Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness, and reverence towards the gods must be inviolate. Great words of prideful men are ever punished with great blows, and in old age teach the chastened to be wise.’

<span class="line-ref">Line 3</span><p>Again, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Points bearing on the relation of L to the other MSS.</note> this play presents some points of curious interest in regard to the much-discussed question whether L is the source from which all other known MSS. of Sophocles have been derived.</p>
<p>(1) There are two places in which an apparently true reading has been preserved by some of the later MSS., while L has an apparently false one. The first example is in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 386" valid="yes">v. 386</bibl>, where L has <quote lang="greek">εἰς μέσον</quote>, while A and others have <quote lang="greek">εἰς δέον</quote>. Some editors, indeed, prefer <quote lang="greek">εἰς μέσον</quote>: but A's reading seems far preferable (see comment.). The other example is clearer. In <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 831" valid="yes">v. 831</bibl> L has <quote lang="greek">τάκει</quote>, a manifest error, occasioned by <quote lang="greek">τακομέναν</quote> shortly before. The true reading, <quote lang="greek">τέγγει</quote>, is in A and other of the MSS. later than L.</p>
<p>(2) Verse <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1167" valid="yes">1167</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">ζῆν τοῦτον, ἀλλ’ ἔμψυχον ἡγοῦμαι νεκρόν</quote>, is in none of the MSS. It is supplied by Athenaeus 7. 280 C, who quotes <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1165" valid="yes">vv. 1165-1171</bibl>. The earliest printed edition which contains it is that of Turnebus (Paris, <date authname="1553" value="1553">1553 A.D.</date>). Now Eustathius (p. 957. 17) quotes v. 1165 (partly) and v. 1166,—remarking that, after v. 1166, ‘the careful copies’ (<quote lang="greek">τὰ ἀκριβῆ ἀντίγραφα</quote>) give the verse <quote lang="greek">ζῆν τοῦτον, ἀλλ’ ἔμψυχον ἡγοῦμαι νεκρόν</quote>. Eustathius wrote in the <dateRange authname="1150/1200" from="1150" to="1200">second half of the 12th century</dateRange>: L was written in the <dateRange authname="1000/1050" from="1000" to="1050">first half of the eleventh century</dateRange>. It would be a very forced explanation to suppose that Eustathius, in speaking of <quote lang="greek">τὰ ἀκριβῆ ἀντίγραφα</quote>, meant those MSS. of Sophocles on which Athenaeus, some 1000 years before, had relied for his quotation; or, again, those MSS. of Athenaeus in which Eustathius found it. According to the natural (or rather, the necessary) sense of the words, Eustathius is referring to MSS. of Sophocles extant in his own time. But did his memory deceive him, leading him to ascribe to MSS. of Sophocles what he had seen in Athenaeus? This, again, would be a very bold assumption. His statement has a <foreign lang="la">prima facie</foreign> claim to acceptance in its plain sense. And if his statement is accepted, it follows that, when L was written (in the first half of the eleventh century), two classes of MSS. of Sophocles could be distinguished by the presence or absence of verse 1167. But that verse is absent from every MS. of Sophocles now known. If, therefore, L was not the common parent of the rest, at any rate that parent (or parents) agreed with L in this striking defect, which (according to Eustathius) could have been corrected from other MSS. known in the twelfth century. There is no other instance in which a fault, now universal in the MSS. of Sophocles, is thus alleged to have been absent from a MS. or MSS. extant after the date at which L was written. Whatever construction may be placed on the statement of Eustathius, it is certain that it deserves to be carefully noted.

<span class="line-ref">Line 4</span><p>This sketch may serve to illustrate the powerful unity<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Unity of motive.</note> of the play. The issue defined in the opening scene,—the conflict of divine with human law,—remains the central interest throughout. The action, so simple in plan, is varied by masterly character-drawing, both in the two principal figures, and in those lesser persons who contribute gradations of light and shade to the picture. There is no halting in the march of the drama; at each successive step we become more and more keenly interested to see how this great conflict is to end; and when the tragic climax is reached, it is worthy of such a progress. It would not,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The mode of the catastrophe.</note> however, be warrantable to describe the construction of the play as faultless. No one who seeks fully to comprehend and enjoy this great work of art can be content to ignore certain questions which are suggested by one part of it,—the part from <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 998" valid="yes">v. 998</bibl> to <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1243" valid="yes">1243</bibl>, which introduces and developes the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Teiresias, as we saw, came with the benevolent purpose of warning Creon that he must bury Polyneices. Creon was stubborn, and Teiresias then said that the gods would punish him. Haemon would die, because his father had been guilty of two sins,—burying Antigone alive<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">In his first, or friendly, speech to Creon (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 998" valid="yes">998-1032</bibl>) Teiresias says not a word concerning Antigone. Possibly he may be conceived as thinking that the burial of Polyneices would imply, as a consequence, the release of Antigone; though it is obvious that, from Creon's point of view, such an inference would be illogical: Antigone was punished because she had broken the edict; not because the burying of Polyneices was intrinsically wrong.</note>, and dishonouring the corpse of Polyneices. This prophecy assumed that Creon would remain obdurate. But, in the event, he immediately yielded; he buried Polyneices, and attempted, though too late, to release Antigone. Now suppose that he had been in time to save Antigone. He would then have cancelled both his offences. And then, we must infer, the divine punishment predicted by Teiresias would have been averted; since the prediction does not rest on any statement that a specific term of grace had expired. Otherwise we should have to suppose that the seer did not know the true mind of the gods when he represented that Creon might still be saved by repentance (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1025" valid="yes">1025 ff.</bibl>). But the dramatic function of Teiresias obviously requires us to assume that he was infallible whenever he spoke from ‘the signs of his art’; indeed, the play tells us that he was so (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1094" valid="yes">1094</bibl>).</p>
<p>Everything depended, then, on Creon being in time to save Antigone. Only a very short interval can be imagined between the moment at which she is led away to her tomb and that at which Creon resolves to release her; in the play it is measured by 186 verses (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 928" valid="yes">928-1114</bibl>). The Chorus puts Creon's duties in the natural order; ‘free the maiden from her rocky chamber, and make a tomb for the unburied dead’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1100" valid="yes">1100</bibl>); and Creon seems to feel that the release, as the more urgent task, ought to have precedence. Nevertheless, when he and his men arrive on the ground, his first care is given to Polyneices. After the rites have been performed, a high mound is raised. Only then does he proceed to Antigone's prison,—and then it is too late. We are not given any reason for the burial being taken in hand before the release. The dramatic fault here has nothing to do with any estimate of the chances that Creon might actually have saved Antigone's life, if he had gone to her first. The poet might have chosen to imagine her as destroying herself immediately after she had been left alone in her cell. In any case, the margin for Creon must have been a narrow one. The<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The dramatic blemish.</note> dramatic fault is that, while we, the spectators, are anxious that Antigone should be saved, and while every moment is precious, we are left to conjecture why Creon should be spending so many of these moments in burial rites which could have been rendered equally well after Antigone had been rescued: nay, when the rites have been finished, he remains to build a mound. The source of pathos contained in the words ‘too late’ is available for Tragedy, but evidently there is one condition which must be observed. A fatal delay must not seem to be the result merely of negligence or of caprice. As Bellermann has justly said, modern drama has obeyed this rule with a heedfulness not always shown by the ancients. Shakespeare took care that there should be a good reason for the delay of Lorenzo to resuscitate Juliet; nor has Schiller, in the <title>Death of Wallenstein,</title> left it obscure why Octavio arrived only after Buttler's deed had been done. Euripides, on the other hand, is content that the prolixity of a Messenger's speech should detain Iocasta until the sons whom she longed to reconcile had killed each other.

<p>Schneidewin gives Eurydice to the second actor, and the two Messengers to the first actor. But, as the part of Eurydice is much lighter than the combined parts of the Messengers, it is more naturally assigned to the first actor, who already bears the heaviest burden.

<span class="line-ref">Line 5</span><p>With regard to Creon's delay in the <title>Antigone</title>, I venture <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">A suggested explanation.</note> to suggest that the true explanation is a simple one. If it seems inadequate when tried by the gauge of modern drama, it will not do so (I think) to those who remember two characteristics of old Greek drama,—first, the great importance of the rhetorical element, more particularly as represented by the speeches of messengers; secondly, the occasional neglect of clearness, and even of consistency, in regard to matters which either precede the action of the drama (<quote lang="greek">τὰ ἔξω τῆς τραγῳδίας</quote>), or, though belonging to the drama itself, occur off the stage. The speech of the first Messenger in the <title>Antigone</title> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1192" valid="yes">1192-1243</bibl>) relates the catastrophe with which the tragedy culminates. Its effect was therefore of the highest importance. Now, if this speech had first related the terrible scene in Antigone's tomb, and had then passed on to the quiet obsequies of Polyneices, its rhetorical impressiveness would have been destroyed. It was indispensable that the latter part of the recital should correspond with the climax of tragic interest. This, I believe, was the motive present to the poet's mind when, after indicating in the dialogue that the release was to precede the burial, he reversed that order in composing the Messenger's speech. He knew that his Athenian audience would be keenly susceptible to the oratorical quality of that speech, while they would be either inattentive, or very indulgent, to the defect in point of dramatic consistency. The result is a real blemish, though not a serious one; indeed, it may be said to compensate the modern reader for its existence by exemplifying some tendencies of the art which admitted it.

<span class="line-ref">Line 5</span><p>Among the interpolations which modern criticism has suspected,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Interpolation.</note> there is one which is distinguished from the rest alike by extent and by importance. This is the passage, founded on <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 3.119" valid="yes">Herodotus 3. 119</bibl>, in Antigone's last speech. I concur in the opinion of those who think that this passage,—i.e., <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 904" valid="yes">vv. 904-920</bibl>,—cannot have stood in the text as Sophocles left it. The point is one of vital moment for our whole conception of the play. Much has been written upon it; indeed, it has a small literature of its own; but I am not acquainted with any discussion of it which appears to me satisfactory. In a note in the Appendix I have attempted to state clearly the reasons for my belief, and to show how the arguments on the other side can be answered.</p>
<p>This is the only passage of the play which seems to afford solid ground for the hypothesis of interpolation. It is right, however, to subjoin a list of the verses which have been suspected by the critics whose names are attached to them severally. Many of these cases receive discussion in the notes; but there are others which did not require it, because the suspicion is so manifestly baseless. It will be seen that, if effect were given to all these indictments, the <title>Antigone</title> would suffer a loss of nearly 80 verses.

<span class="line-ref">Line 6</span><p>The simplicity of the plot <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The question raised by the play.</note>is due,—as the foregoing sketch has shown,—to the clearness with which two principles are opposed to each other. Creon represents the duty of obeying the State's laws; Antigone, the duty of listening to the private conscience. The definiteness and the power with which the play puts the case on each side are conclusive proofs that the question had assumed a distinct shape before the poet's mind. It is the only instance in which a Greek play has for its central theme a practical problem of conduct, involving issues, moral and political, which might be discussed on similar grounds in any age and in any country of the world. Greek Tragedy, owing partly to the limitations which it placed on detail, was better suited than modern drama to raise such a question in a general form. The <title>Antigone</title>, indeed, raises the question in a form as nearly abstract as is compatible with the nature of drama. (The case of Antigone is a thoroughly typical one for the private conscience, because the particular thing which she believes that she ought to do was, in itself, a thing which every Greek of that age recognised as a most sacred duty,— viz., to render burial rites to kinsfolk.) This advantage was not devised by Sophocles; it came to him as part of the story which he was to dramatise; but it forms an additional reason for thinking that, when he dramatised that story in the precise manner which he has choscn, he had a consciously dialectical purpose<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">This point might be illustrated by contrast with an able romance, of which the title is borrowed from this play of Sophocles. ‘The New Antigone’ declined the sanction of marriage, because she had been educated by a father who had taught her to regard that institution as wrongful. Such a case was not well suited to do dramatically what the <title>Antigone</title> of Sophocles does,—to raise the question of human law against private conscience in a general form,—because the institution concerned claims to be more than a human ordinance, and because, on the other hand, the New Antigone's opinion was essentially an accident of perverted conscience. The author of the work was fully alive to this, and has said (<bibl default="NO"><title>Spectator</title>, Nov. 5, 1887</bibl>) that his choice of a title conveyed ‘a certain degree of irony.’</note> Such a purpose was wholly consistent, in this instance, with the artist's first aim,—to produce a work of art. It is because Creon and Antigone are so human that the controversy which they represent becomes so vivid.

<span class="line-ref">Line 7</span><p>But how did Sophocles intend us to view the result?<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">What is the moral intended?</note> What is the drift of the words at the end, which say that ‘wisdom is the supreme part of happiness’? If this wisdom, or prudence (<quote lang="greek">τὸ φρονεῖν</quote>), means, generally, the observance of due limit, may not the suggested moral be that both the parties to the conflict were censurable? As Creon overstepped the due limit when, by his edict, he infringed the divine law, so Antigone also overstepped it when she defied the edict. The drama would thus be a conflict between two persons, each of whom defends an intrinsically sound principle, but defends it in a mistaken way; and both persons are therefore punished. This view, of which Boeckh is the chief representative, has found several supporters. Among them is Hegel:—‘In the view of the Eternal Justice, both were wrong, because they were onesided; but at the same time both were right<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Religionsphilosophie</title>, II. 114.</note>.’</p>
<p>Or does the poet rather intend us to feel that Antigone is wholly in the right,—i.e., that nothing of which the human lawgiver could complain in her was of a moment's account beside the supreme duty which she was fulfilling;—and that Creon was wholly in the wrong,—i.e., that the intrinsically sound maxims of government on which he relies lose all validity when opposed to the higher law which he was breaking? If that was the poet's meaning, then the ‘wisdom’ taught by the issue of the drama means the sense which duly subordinates human to divine law,—teaching that, if the two come into conflict, human law must yield.</p>
<p>This question is one which cannot be put aside by merely suggesting that Sophocles had no didactic purpose at all, but left us to take whichever view we please. For, obviously, according as we adopt one or other of the views, our estimate of the play as a work of art must be vitally affected. The punishments meted out to Creon and Antigone respectively require us to consider the grounds on which they rest. A difference will be made, too, in our conception of Antigone's character, and therefore in our judgment as to the measure of skill with which the poet has portrayed her.</p>
<p>A careful study of the play itself will suffice (I think) to show that the second of the two views above mentioned is the true one. Sophocles has allowed Creon to put his case ably, and (in a measure from which an inferior artist might have shrunk) he has been content to make Antigone merely a nobly heroic woman, not a being exempt from human passion and human weakness; but none the less does he mean us to feel that, in this controversy, the right is wholly with her, and the wrong wholly with her judge.

<span class="line-ref">Line 8</span><p>In the first place it is necessary to appreciate the nature of Creon's edict <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The character of Creon's edict.</note> against burying Polyneices. Some modern estimates of the play have seemed to assume that such refusal of sepulture, though a harsh measure, was yet one which the Greek usage of the poet's age recognised as fairly applicable to public enemies, and that, therefore, Creon's fault lay merely in the degree of his severity. It is true that the legends of the heroic age afford some instances in which a dead enemy is left unburied, as a special mark of abhorrence. This dishonour brands the exceptionally base crime of Aegisthus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1487" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 1487</bibl> ff.</note> Yet these same legends also show that, from a very early period, Hellenic feeling was shocked at the thought of carrying enmity beyond the grave, and withholding those rites on which the welfare of the departed spirit was believed to depend. The antiquity of the maxim that, after a battle, the conquerors were bound to allow the vanquished to bury their dead, is proved by the fact that it was ascribed either to Theseus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Plut. Thes. 29" valid="yes">Plut. <title>Thes.</title> 29.</bibl></note> or to Heracles<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Aelian <title>Var. Hist.</title> 12. 27.</note>. Achilles maltreated the dead Hector. Yet, even there, the <title>Iliad</title> expresses the Greek feeling by the beautiful and touching fable that the gods themselves miraculously preserved the corpse from all defacement and from all corruption, until at last the due obsequies were rendered to it in Troy<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 24.411" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 24.411</bibl> ff.</note>. The Atreidae refused burial to Ajax; but Odysseus successfully pleaded against the sentence, and Ajax was ultimately buried with all honour<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"> <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 1332" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 1332</bibl> ff.</note>. In giving that issue to his play, Sophocles was doing what the general feeling of his own age would strongly demand. Greeks of the fifth century B.C. observed the duty towards the dead even when warfare was bitterest, and when the foe was barbarian. The Athenians buried the Persians slain at Marathon, as the Persians buried the Lacedaemonians slain at Thermopylae. A notable exception may, indeed, be cited; but it is one of those exceptions which forcibly illustrate the rule. The Spartan Lysander omitted to bury the Athenians who fell at Aegospotami; and that omission was remembered, centuries later, as an indelible stigma upon his name<note anchored="yes" n="5" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 9.32.6" valid="yes">Paus. 9.32.6</bibl>.</note>.</p>
<p>Thus the audience for which Sophocles composed the <title>Antigone</title> would regard Creon's edict as something very different from a measure of exceptional, but still legitimate, severity. They would regard it as a shocking breach of that common piety which even the most exasperated belligerents regularly respected.

<span class="line-ref">Line 9</span><p>The next point to be considered is, In what sense,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The edict in its political aspect.</note> and how far, does Creon, in this edict, represent the State? He is the lawful king of Thebes. His royal power is conceived as having no definite limit. The words of the Chorus testify that he is acting within the letter of his right; ‘thou hast power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who live’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 211" valid="yes">211 f.</bibl>). On the other hand, he is acting against the unanimous, though silent, sense of Thebes, which, as his son Haemon tells him, held that Antigone had done a glorious deed (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 695" valid="yes">695</bibl>). Creon replies: ‘Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I shall rule?’ His son rejoins: ‘That is no city (<quote lang="greek">πόλις</quote>), which belongs to one man’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 737" valid="yes">737</bibl>). Where the unanimous opinion of the community was ignored, the Athenians of the poet's day would feel that, as Haemon says, there was no ‘city’ at all. Indeed, when Creon summoned ‘the conference of elders,’ that summons was itself an admission that he was morally bound to take account of other judgments besides his own. We may often notice in the Attic drama that the constitutional monarchy of the legendary heroic age is made to act in the spirit, and speak in the tone, of the unconstitutional <foreign lang="la">tyrannus</foreign>, as the historical age knew it. This was most natural; it gave an opening for points sure to tell with a ‘tyrant-hating’ Athenian audience, and it was perfectly safe from objection on the ground of anachronism,—an objection which was about the last that Athenian spectators were likely to raise, if we may judge by the practice of the dramatists. Now, the Creon of the <title>Antigone</title>, though nominally a monarch of the heroic age, has been created by the Attic poet in the essential image of the historical <foreign lang="la">tyrannus.</foreign> The Attic audience would mentally compare him, not to an Agamemnon or an Alcinous, but to a Hippias or a Periander. He resembles the ruler whose absolutism, imposed on the citizens by force, is devoid of any properly political sanction. [Antigone can certainly be described, with technical correctness, as acting ‘in despite of the State,’ since Creon is the State, so far as a State exists.] But the Greeks for whom Sophocles wrote would not regard Creon's edict as having a constitutional character, in the sense in which that character belonged to laws sanctioned (for instance) by the Athenian Ecclesia. They would liken it rather to some of the arbitrary and violent acts done by Hippias in the later period of his ‘tyranny.’ To take a modern illustration, they would view it in a quite different light from that in which we should regard the disobedience of a Russian subject to a ukase of the Czar.</p>
<p>If, then, we endeavour to interpret Creon's action by the standards which the poet's contemporaries would apply, we find, first, that he is doing a monstrous act; secondly, that, in doing it, he cannot, indeed, be said to exceed his prerogative, since this is indefinite; but he is exceeding his moral right in such a manner that he becomes the counterpart of the <foreign lang="la">tyrannus</foreign> who makes a cruel use of an unconstitutional power.

She and her sister are the nearest kinsfolk of the dead. It is not to be expected that any stranger should brave the edict for the dead man's sake. As the Chorus says, ‘no man is so foolish that he is enamoured of death’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 220" valid="yes">220</bibl>). Creon is furious when the Chorus suggests that the rites so mysteriously paid to the corpse may have been due to the agency of the gods (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 278" valid="yes">278 f.</bibl>). That very suggestion of the Chorus shows how impossible it seemed to the Theban mind that Polyneices could receive the ministration of any human hand. A modern critic, taking the view that Antigone was wrong, has observed (not ironically) that she ought to have left the gods to provide the burial. It would have been ill for the world if all who have done heroic deeds had preferred to await miracles. As to another suggestion,—that Antigone ought to have tried persuasion with Creon,—the poet has supplied the answer in his portraiture of Creon's character,—a character known to Antigone from long experience. The situation in which Antigone was placed by Creon's edict was analogous to that of a Christian martyr under the Roman Empire. It was as impossible for Antigone to withhold those rites, which no other human being could now render, as it was impossible for the Christian maiden to avoid the torments of the arena by laying a grain of incense on the altar of Diana<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Mr Long's beautiful picture, ‘Diana or Christ,’ will be remembered by many,— and the more fitly, since it presents a counterpart, not only for Antigone, but also for Creon and for Haemon.</note>. From both alike those laws which each believed to be ‘the unfailing statutes of Heaven’ claimed an allegiance which no human law could cancel, and it was by the human ruler, not by his victim, that the conflict of loyalties had been made inevitable.

<span class="line-ref">Line 11</span><p>One of the main arguments <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The attitude of the Chorus.</note> used to show that Sophocles conceived Antigone as partly censurable has been drawn from the utterances of the Chorus. It is therefore important to determine, if we can, what the attitude of these Theban Elders really is. Their first ode (the Parodos) shows how strongly they condemn Polyneices, as having led a hostile army against his country. We might have expected, then, that, when Creon acquainted them with his edict, they would have greeted it with some mark of approval. On the contrary, their words are confined to a brief utterance of submission: ‘Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menoeceus, touching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who live’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 211" valid="yes">211 ff.</bibl>). We can see that they are startled by such a doom, even for a man whom they hold deeply guilty. Their words suggest a misgiving. Just afterwards, they significantly excuse themselves from taking any part in the enforcement of the edict (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 216" valid="yes">216</bibl>). But it is otherwise when the edict, having been published, is broken. Then they range themselves on Creon's side. They refer to the disobedience as a daring offence (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 371" valid="yes">371</bibl>). When Antigone is brought in, they speak of her folly (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 383" valid="yes">383</bibl>). Nevertheless, Antigone is convinced that, in their hearts, they sympathise with her (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 504" valid="yes">504</bibl>). And, indeed, it is plain that they do so, to this extent,—that they consider the edict to have been a mistake; though they also hold that it was wrong to break the edict. Hence they speak of Antigone's act as one prompted by ‘frenzy at the heart’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 603" valid="yes">603</bibl>). The clearest summary of their whole view—up to this point of the drama—is given in verses <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 872" valid="yes">872-875</bibl>, and amounts to this:—Antigone's act was, in itself, a pious one; but Creon, as a ruler, was bound to vindicate his edict. Her ‘self-willed temper’ has brought her to death.</p>
<p>So far, then, the view taken by the Chorus is very much Boeckh's:—the merits are divided; Creon is both right and wrong; so, too, is Antigone. But then Teiresias comes (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 988" valid="yes">v. 988</bibl>), and convinces the Chorus that Creon has been wholly wrong; wrong in refusing burial to Polyneices; wrong in punishing Antigone. It is at the urgent advice of the Chorus that Creon yields. And when, a little later, Creon blames himself as the cause of all the woe, the Chorus replies that now at last he sees the truth (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1270" valid="yes">v. 1270</bibl>). Thus the Theban Elders entertain two different opinions in succession. Their first opinion is overthrown by Teiresias. Their second opinion—which they hold from verse 1091 onwards—is that which the poet intends to be recognised as the true one.

<span class="line-ref">Line 12</span><p>After thus tracing the mind of the Chorus, we can see<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Why the Chorus is so constituted.</note> more clearly why it is composed of Theban elders. When the chief person of a Greek tragedy is a woman, the Chorus usually consists of women, whose attitude towards the heroine is more or less sympathetic. Such is the case in the <title>Electra</title> and the <title>Trachiniae</title>, and in seven plays of Euripides,—the <title>Andromache</title>, <title>Electra</title>, <title>Hecuba</title>, <title>Helena</title>, both <title>Iphigeneias</title>, and <title>Medea.</title> The Chorus of the <title>Alcestis</title>, indeed, consists of Pheraean elders: but then Alcestis is withdrawn from the scene at an early moment, and restored to it only at the end: during the rest of the play, the interest is centred in Admetus. In the <title>Antigone</title>, Sophocles had a double reason for constituting the Chorus as he did. First, the isolation of the heroine would have been less striking if she had been supported by a group of sympathetic women. Secondly, the natural predisposition of the Theban nobles to support their king heightens the dramatic effect of their ultimate conversion.

<span class="line-ref">Line 13</span><p>The character of Antigone is a separate question from<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Character of Antigone.</note> the merit of the cause in which she is engaged. She might be doing right, and yet the poet might have represented her as doing it in such a manner as to render her heroism unattractive. We may now turn to this question, and consider what manner of woman she is.</p>
<p>Two qualities are at the basis of her character. One is an enthusiasm, at once steadfast and passionate, for the right, as she sees it,—for the performance of her duty. The other is intense tenderness, purity, and depth of domestic affection; manifested here in the love of sister for brother, a love which death has not weakened, but only consecrated; as in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>—where the portraiture of her is entirely in unison with that given here—it is manifested in the tender anxiety to reconcile her living brothers, and in the fearless, completely selfless devotion—through painful wanderings, through all misery and all reproach—to the old age of her blind and homeless father. In the opening scene of the play, we find her possessed by a burning indignation at the outrage done to her dead brother; the deep love which she feels for him is braced by a clear sense of the religious duty which this edict lays upon her, and by an unfaltering resolve to do it; it never occurs to her for an instant that, as a true sister, she could act otherwise; rather it seems wonderful to her that the author of the edict should even have expected it to prove deterrent—for <emph>her</emph> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 32" valid="yes">ver. 32</bibl>).</p>
<p>With her whole heart and soul <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Her relation to Ismene.</note> dominated by these feelings, she turns to her sister Ismene, and asks for her aid; not as if the response could be doubtful—she cannot imagine its being doubtful; it does not enter her mind that one whom she has just addressed by so dear a name, and with whom her tie of sisterhood is made closer still by the destiny which has placed them apart, can be anything but joyful and proud to risk life in the discharge of a duty so plain, so tender, and so sacred. And how does Ismene meet her? Ismene reminds her that other members of their house have perished miserably, and that, if Antigone acts thus, Antigone and she will die more miserably still: they are women, and must not strive with men; they are subjects, and must not strive with rulers: Ismene will ask the dead to excuse her, since she is constrained, and will obey the living: ‘for it is witless <emph>to be over-busy</emph>’ (<quote lang="greek">περισσὰ πράσσειν</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 68" valid="yes">v. 68</bibl>). Ismene is amiable enough; she cannot be called exceptionally weak or timid; she is merely the average woman; her answer here is such as would have been made by most women—and perhaps by a still larger proportion of men, as the Chorus afterwards forcibly reminds us. But, given the character and the present mood of Antigone, what must be the effect of such a reply to such an appeal? It is the tenderness, quite as much as the strength, of Antigone's spirit that speaks in her answer:—‘I will not urge thee,—no, nor, if thou yet shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me.’ And the calmest reason thoroughly approves that answer; for the very terms in which Ismene had repulsed her sister proved a nature which could never rise to the height of such a task, and which would be more dangerous as an ally than as a neutral.</p>
<p>When the sisters next meet, it is in Creon's presence, and the situation is this:—Antigone has done the deed, unaided; and Creon has said that both sisters shall die—for he suspects Ismene of complicity. Ismene's real affection is now quickened by a fevcrish remorse, and by an impulse towards self-immolation,— an impulse of a sentimental and almost hysterical kind: she will say that she helped Antigone; she will die with her; she will yet make amends to the dead. Was Antigone to indulge Ismene's impulse, and to allow Ismene's words to confirm Creon's suspicions? Surely Antigone was bound to do what she does,—namely, to speak out the truth: ‘Nay, Justice will not suffer thee to do that; thou didst <emph>not</emph> consent to the deed, neither did I give thee part in it.’ But it will be said that her tone towards Ismene is too stern and hard. The sternness is only that of truth; the hardness is only that of reality: for, among the tragic circumstances which surround Antigone, this is precisely one of the most tragic, that Ismene's earlier conduct, at the testing-point of action, <emph>has</emph> made a spiritual division which no emotional after-impulse can cancel. One more point may be raised: when Ismene says, ‘What life is dear to me, bereft of thee?’—Antigone replies, ‘Ask Creon—all thy care is for him’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 549" valid="yes">v. 549</bibl>): is not this, it may be asked, a needless taunt? The answer is found in Antigone's wish to save Ismene's life. Thus far in the dialogue, Ismene has persisted—even after Antigone's denial—in claiming a share in the deed (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 536" valid="yes">vv. 536-547</bibl>). Creon might well think that, after all, the fact was as he suspected. It was necessary for Antigone to make him see—by some trenchant utterance—that she regarded Ismene as distinctly ranged on his side. And she succeeded. Later in the play, where Creon acknowledges Ismene's innocence, he describes it in the very phrase which Antigone had impressed upon his memory; he speaks of Ismene as one ‘<emph>who has not touched</emph>’ the deed (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 771" valid="yes">v. 771</bibl>: cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 546" valid="yes">v. 546</bibl>). It is with pain (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 551" valid="yes">v. 551</bibl>), it is not with scorn or with bitterness, that Antigone remains firm. Her attitude is prescribed equally by regard for truth and right, and by duty towards her sister.
</p>

Ant. 572" valid="yes">572</bibl> is rightly assigned to Antigone (as, in my opinion, it is), that brief utterance tells much: but let us suppose that it belongs to Ismene, and that Antigone never once refers directly to Haemon: we say, ‘directly,’ because more than once she alludes to sweet hopes which life had still to offer her. It is evident that, if Sophocles had given greater prominence to Antigone's love for Haemon, he could have had only one aim, consistently with the plan of this play,—viz., to strengthen our sense of the ties which bound her to life, and, therefore, of her heroism in resigning it. But it is also evident that he could have done this, with any effect, only at the cost of depicting a mind divided between the desire of earthly happiness and the resolve to perform a sacred duty. Sophocles has preferred to portray Antigone as raised above every selfish thought, even the dearest, by the absorbing and inspiring sense of her duty to the dead, and to the gods; silent, not through apathy, concerning a love which could never be hers, and turning for comfort to the faith that, beyond the grave, the purest form of human affection would reunite her to those whom she had lost. It is no blame to later dramatists that they found it necessary to make more of the love-motive; but, if our standard is to be the noblest tragic art, it is a confession of their inferiority to Sophocles. There is a beautiful verse in the play which might suggest how little he can have feared that his heroine would ever be charged with a cold insensibility. Creon has urged that the honour which she has shown to Polyneices will be resented by the spirit of Eteocles. Antigone answers, ‘It is not my nature to join in hating, but in loving.’ As she had sought to reconcile them while they lived, so now she will have no part in their feud—if feud there be where they have gone,—but will love each, as he loves her.</p>
<p>So long as her task lies before Antigone, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The reaction in Antigone's mind.</note> she is sustained by the necessity for action. Nor does she falter for a moment, even after the deed has been done, so long as she is in the presence of Creon. For though she has no longer the stimulus of action, there is still another challenge to her fortitude; she, who is loyal to the divine law, cannot tremble before the man who is its embodied negation. It is otherwise when Creon is gone, and when there are only the Theban elders to see and hear her, as she is led to death. The strain on her mind is relaxed; the end is near; she now feels the longing for some word of pity as she passes to the grave,—for some token of human kindness. But, while she craves such sympathy, the Theban nobles merely console her with the thought of posthumous fame. She compares her doom to Niobe's; and they reply that it is a glory for her to be as Niobe, a daughter of the Tantalidae,— </p><l>the seed of gods, </l><l>Men near to Zeus; for whom on Ida burns, </l><l>High in clear air, the altar of their Sire, </l><l>Nor hath their race yet lost the blood divine<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">From the <title>Niobe</title> of Aeschylus (fr. 157): <quote lang="greek">οἱ θεῶν ἀγχίσποροι, | οἱ Ζηνὸς ἐγγύς· οἷς κατ’ )Ιδαῖον πάγον | Διὸς πατρῴου βωμός ἐστ’ ἐν αἰθέρι, | κοὔπω νιν ἐξίτηλον αἶμα δαιμόνων</quote>.</note>.</l>
<p>Few things in tragedy are more pathetic than this yearning of hers, on the brink of death, for some human kindness of farewell, thus ‘mocked’<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 839" valid="yes">v. 839</bibl>.</note>, as she feels it to be, by a cold assurance of renown. She turns from men to invoke ‘the fount of Dircè and the holy ground of Thebes’; these, at least, will be her witnesses. In her last words, she is thinking of the dead, and of the gods; she feels sure of love in the world of the dead; but she cannot lift her face to the gods, and feel sure that they are with her. If they are so, why have they allowed her to perish for obeying them? Yet, again, they <emph>may</emph> be with her; she will know beyond the grave. If she has sinned, she will learn it there; but if she is innocent, the gods will vindicate when she is gone. How infinitely touching is this supreme trouble which clouds her soul at the last,—this doubt and perplexity concerning the gods! For it is not a misgiving as to the paramount obligation of the ‘unwritten laws’ which she has obeyed: it is only an anguish of wonder and uncertainty as to the mysterious ways of the powers which have laid this obligation on mortals,—a surmise that, as gods and men seem alike without pity for her, there has perhaps been something wrong in her way of doing the duty which was so clear and so binding.

<span class="line-ref">Line 14</span><p>The psychology of Sophocles <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Distinctive merit of the portraiture.</note> is so excellent in the case of Antigone because he has felt that in a truly heroic nature there is the permanent strength of deep convictions, but there is also room for what superficial observers might think a moral anticlimax. So long as such a nature has to meet antagonism in word or deed, its permanent strength is heightened by a further support which is necessarily transient, —the strength of exaltation. But a mind capable of heroism is such as can see duties in their true proportions, and can sacrifice everything to the discharge of the highest: and it is such a mind, too, which, in looking back on a duty done, is most liable—through very largeness of vision, and sense of human limitations—to misgivings like those which vex the last moments of Antigone. The strength of exaltation has passed away; her clear intelligence cannot refuse to acknowledge that the actual results of doing right are in seeming conflict with the faith which was the sanction of the deed. It is worthy of notice that only at one moment of the drama does Antigone speak lightly of the penalty which she has deliberately incurred. That is at the moment when, face to face with Creon, she is asserting the superiority of the divine law. Nor does she, even then, speak lightly of death in itself; she only says that it is better than a life like hers; for at that moment she feels the whole burden of the sorrows which have fallen upon her race,—standing, as she does, before the man who has added the last woe. The tension of her mind is at the highest. But nowhere else does she speak as one who had sought death because weary of life; on the contrary, we can see that that life was dear to her, who must die young, ‘without a portion in the chant that brings the bride.’ It is a perfectly sane mind which has chosen death, and has chosen it only because the alternative was to neglect a sacred duty.</p>
<p>A comparison with other dramatists may serve to illustrate what Sophocles has gained by thus allowing the temporary strength of excitement to pass off before the end, leaving the permanent strength of the character to wrestle with this pain and doubt. In Alfieri's play of the same name, Antigone shows no touch of human weakness; as death approaches, she seems more and more impatiently eager for it; she says to Creon's guards, who are leading her to her doom,—
<quote lang="en"><l>Let us make better speed; so slow a step </l>
<l>Ill becomes her who has at length just reach'd</l>
<l>The goal so long desired... Perhaps ye, O guards,</l>
<l>May feel compassion for my fate?... Proceed.</l>
<l>Oh terrible Death, I look thee in the face,</l>
<l>And yet I tremble not<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">C. Taylor's translation.</note>.</l></quote></p>
<p>In Massinger's <title>Virgin Martyr</title>, again, consider the strain in which Dorothea addresses Theophilus, the persecutor of the Christians, who has doomed her to torture and death:—
<quote lang="en"><l>Thou fool!</l>
<l>That gloriest in having power to ravish</l>
<l>A trifle from me I am weary of,</l>
<l>What is this life to me? Not worth a thought;</l>
<l>Or, if it be esteem'd, 'tis that I lose it</l>
<l>To win a better: even thy malice serves</l>
<l>To me but as a ladder to mount up</l>
<l>To such a height of happiness, where I shall</l>
<l>Look down with scorn on thee and on the world.</l></quote></p>
<p>The dramatic effect of such a tone, both in Alfieri's Antigone and in Massinger's Dorothea, is to make their fate not more, but less, pathetic; we should feel for them more if they, on their part, seemed to feel a little ‘what 'tis to die, and to die young,’— as Theophilus says to Dorothea. On the other hand, M. Casimir Delavigne, in his <title>Messéniennes</title>, is Sophoclean where he describes the last moments of Joan of Arc:
<quote lang="fr"><l>Du Christ, avec l'ardeur, Jeanne baisait l'image;</l>
<l>Ses longs cheveux épars flottaient au gré des vents:</l>
<l>Au pied de l'échafaud, sans changer de visage,</l>
<l>Elle s'avançait à pas lents.</l>
<l>Tranquille elle y monta; quand, debout sur le faîte,</l>
<l>Elle vit ce bûcher, qui l'allait dévorer,</l>
<l>Les bourreaux en suspens, la flamme déja prête,</l>

<l><emph>Et se prit à pleurer</emph><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Quoted by M. Patin in his <title lang="fr">Études sur les Tragiques grecs</title>, vol. II., p. 271.</note>.</l></quote></p>
<p>So it is that the Antigone of Sophocles, in the last scene of her life, feels her heart fail, bows her head, and weeps; but the first verse of the passage just quoted suggests a difference which makes the Greek maiden the more tragic figure of the two: when Antigone looked to heaven, she could find no certain comfort.</p>
<p>Thus has Sophocles created a true heroine; no fanatic enamoured of martyrdom, no virago, but a true woman, most tender-hearted, most courageous and steadfast; whose sense of duty sustains her in doing a deed for which she knows that she must die;—when it has been done, and death is at hand, then, indeed, there is a brief cry of anguish from that brave and loving spirit; it is bitter to die thus: but human sympathy is denied to her, and even the gods seem to have hidden their faces. Nowhere else has the poetry of the ancient world embodied so lofty or so beautiful an ideal of woman's love and devotion. The Macaria of Euripides resigns her life to save the race of the Heracleidae; his Iphigeneia, to prosper the course of the Greek fleet; his Alcestis, to save the life of her husband. In each of these cases, a divine voice had declared that some one must die; in each, the heroism required was purely passive; and in each a definite gain was promised,—for it was at least a pious opinion in the wife of Admetus (when all his other friends had declined his request that some of them would oblige him by dying for him)<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Has the total absence of the sense of humour, in its disastrous effect upon tragic pathos, ever been more wonderfully illustrated than by Euripides in those lines of the <title>Alcestis?</title>—<cit><quote lang="greek"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" type="trimeter"><l>πάντας δ’ ἐλέγξας καὶ διεξελθὼν φίλους,</l>

Not one of these Euripidean heroines, pathetic though they be, can for a moment be ranked with Fedalma in George Eliot's <title>Spanish Gypsy</title>, when she accepts what seems worse than death for the sake of benefits to her race which are altogether doubtful;— <quote lang="en"><l>‘my soul is faint—</l>
<l>Will these sharp pains buy any certain good?’</l></quote></p>
<p>But Antigone is greater than Fedalma. There was no father, no Zarca, at Antigone's side, urgently claiming the sacrifice,— on the contrary, there was a sister protesting against it; Antigone's choice was wholly free; the heroism which it imposed was one of doing as well as suffering; and the sole reward was to be in the action itself.

<span class="line-ref">Line 15</span><p>The character of Creon, as Sophocles draws it in this<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Creon.</note> play, may be regarded in somewhat different lights. It is interesting, then, to inquire how the poet meant it to be read. According to one view, Creon is animated by a personal spite against both Polyneices and Antigone; his maxims of statepolicy are mere pretexts. This theory seems mistaken. There is, indeed, one phrase which might suggest previous dissensions between Creon and Antigone (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 562" valid="yes">v. 562</bibl>). It is also true that Creon is supposed to have sided with Eteocles when Polyneices was driven into exile. But Sophocles was too good a dramatist to lay stress on such motives in such a situation. Rather, surely, Creon is to be conceived as entirely sincere and profoundly earnest when he sets forth the public grounds of his action. They are briefly these. Anarchy is the worst evil that can befall a State: the first duty of a ruler is therefore to enforce law and maintain order. The safety of the individual depends on that of the State, and therefore every citizen has a direct interest in obedience. This obedience must be absolute and unquestioning. The ruler must be obeyed ‘in little things and great, in just things <emph>and unjust</emph>’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 667" valid="yes">v. 667</bibl>). That is, the subject must never presume to decide for himself what commands may be neglected or resisted. By rewarding the loyal and punishing the disloyal, a ruler will promote such obedience.</p>
<p>Creon puts his case with lucidity and force. We are reminded<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comparison with Plato's <title>Crito.</title></note> of that dialogue in which Plato represents Socrates, on the eve of execution, as visited in prison by his aged friend Crito, who comes to tell him that the means of escape have been provided, and to urge that he should use them. Socrates imagines the Laws of Athens remonstrating with him:  ‘Do you imagine that a State can subsist, in which the decisions of law are set aside by individuals?’ And to the plea that ‘unjust’ decisions may be disobeyed, the Laws rejoin,—‘Was <emph>that</emph> our agreement with you? Or were you to abide by the sentence of the State?’ When Antigone appeals to the laws of Hades (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 451" valid="yes">v. 451</bibl>), might not Creon's laws, then, say to her what the laws of Athens say with regard to the hypothetical flight of Socrates:—‘We shall be angry with you while you live, and our brethren, the Laws in the world below, will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy us’?</p>
<p>Plato, it has been truly said, never intended to answer the question of casuistry, as to when, if ever, it is right to break the city's law. But at least there is one broad difference between the cases supposed in the <title>Crito</title> and the <title>Antigone.</title> Antigone had a positive religious duty, about which there was no doubt at all, and with which Creon's law conflicted. For Socrates to break prison might be justifiable, but could not be described as a positive religious duty; since, however much good he might feel confident of effecting by preserving his life, he was at least morally entitled to think that such good would be less than the evil of the example. Creon is doing what, in the case of Socrates, Athens did not do,—he is invading the acknowledged province of religion. Not that he forgets the existence of the gods: he reveres them in what he believes to be the orthodox way<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See especially the note <ref targOrder="U" target="cl1044">on 1044</ref>.</note>. But he assumes that under no imaginable circumstances can the gods disapprove of penalties inflicted on a disloyal citizen. Meanwhile his characteristic tendency ‘to do everything too much’ has led him into a step which renders this assumption disastrous. He punishes Polyneices in a manner which violates religion.</p>
<p>In Antigone, again, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Creon's attitude towards Antigone</note>he sees anarchy personified, since, having disobeyed, she seems to glory therein (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 482" valid="yes">v. 482</bibl>). Her defence is unmeaning to him, for her thoughts move in a different region from his own. Sophocles has brought this out with admirable skill in a short dialogue between Creon and Antigone (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 508" valid="yes">508-525</bibl>): we see that he cannot get beyond his principle of State rewards and punishments; she is speaking foolishness to him— as, indeed, from the first she had felt the hopelessness of their understanding each other (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 469" valid="yes">469 f.</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 499" valid="yes">499 f.</bibl>). As this dialogue serves to show Creon's unconsciousness of the frontier between divine and human law, so his scene with Haemon brings out his incapacity to appreciate the other great motive of Antigone's conduct,—sisterly piety. Creon regards the Family almost exclusively in one aspect; for him it is an institution related to the State as the gymnasium to the stadium; it is a little State, in which a man may prove that he is fit to govern a larger one.</p>
<p>Creon's temper is hasty and vehement. He vows that Haemon ‘shall not save those two girls from their doom’; but, when the Chorus pleads for Ismene, he quickly adds that he will spare <emph>her</emph>,—‘thou sayest well’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 770" valid="yes">770 f.</bibl>). We also notice his love of hyperbole (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1039" valid="yes">1039 ff.</bibl>). But he is not malevolent. He represents the rigour of human law,—neither restricted by the sense of a higher law, nor intensified by a personal desire to hurt. He has the ill-regulated enthusiasm of a somewhat narrow understanding for the only principle which it has firmly grasped.

<span class="line-ref">Line 16</span><p>Such, then, are the general characteristics which mark the treatment of this subject by Sophocles. In a drama of rare poetical beauty, and of especially fine psychology, he has raised the question as to the limit of the State's authority over the individual conscience. It belongs to the essence of the tragic pathos that this question is one which can never be answered by a set formula. Enough for Antigone that she finds herself in a situation where conscience leaves her no choice but to break one of two laws, and to die.</p>
<p>These distinctive qualities of the play may be illustrated by a glance at the work of some other poets. The <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides is now represented only by a few small fragments,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Euripides.</note> and its plot is uncertain. It would seem, however, that, when Antigone was caught in the act of burial, Haemon was assisting her, and that the play ended, not with her death, but with her marriage<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">All that we know as to the plot is contained in the <ref targOrder="U" target="hyp1">first Argument</ref> to this play: ‘The story has been used also by Euripides in his <title>Antigone</title>; only there she is detected with Haemon, and is given in marriage, and bears a son Maion.’ In the scholia at the end of L we also read, ‘this play differs from the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides in the fact that, there, she was detected through the love of Haemon, and was given in marriage; while here the issue is the contrary’ (i.e. her death). That this is the right rendering of the scholiast's words— <quote lang="greek">φωραθεῖσα ἐκείνη διὰ τὸν Αἵμονος ἔρωτα ἐξεδόθη πρὸς γάμον</quote>—seems probable from a comparison with the statement in the Argument; though others have understood, ‘she was detected, and, owing to the love of Haemon, given in marriage.’ She was detected, not, as in the play of Sophocles, directly by Creon's guards, but (in some way not specified) through the fact that Haemon's love for her had drawn him to her side. Welcker (<title>Griech. Trag.</title> II. pp. 563 ff.) has sought to identify the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides with the plot sketched by Hyginus in <bibl default="NO" n="Hyg. Fab. 72"><title>Fab.</title> 72</bibl>. Antigone having been detected, Haemon had been commissioned by Creon to slay her, but had saved her, conveying her to a shepherd's home. When Maion, the son of their secret marriage, had grown to man's estate, he visited Thebes at a festival. This was the moment (Welcker thinks) at which the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides began. Creon noted in Maion a certain mark which all the offspring of the dragon's seed (<quote lang="greek">σπαρτοί</quote>) bore on their bodies. Haemon's disobedience was thus revealed; Heracles vainly interceded with Creon; Haemon slew his wife Antigone and then himself. But surely both the author of the Argument and the scholiast clearly imply that the marriage of Antigone was contained in the play of Euripides, and formed its conclusion. I therefore agree with Heydemann (<bibl default="NO"><title lang="de">Über eine nacheuripideische Antigone</title>, Berlin, 1868</bibl>) that Hyginus was epitomising some otherwise unknown play. M. Patin (<bibl default="NO"><title lang="fr">Études sur les Tragiques grecs</title>, vol. II. p. 277</bibl>) remarks that there is nothing to show whether the play of Euripides was produced before or after that of Sophocles. But he has overlooked a curious and decisive piece of evidence. Among the scanty fragments of the Euripidean <title>Antigone</title> are these lines (<bibl default="NO">Eur. fr. 165, Nauck</bibl>); —<quote lang="greek">ἄκουσον· οὐ γὰρ οἱ κακῶς πεπραγότες | σὺν ταῖς τύχαισι τοὺς λόγους ἀπώλεσαν</quote>. This evidently glances at the <title>Antigone</title> of Sophocles, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 563" valid="yes">vv. 563 f.</bibl>, where Ismene says, <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ὃς ἂν βλάστη μένει | νοῦς τοῖς κακῶς πράσσουσιν, ἀλλ’ ἐξίσταται</quote>. (For similar instances of covert criticism, see n. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1116" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1116</bibl>.)</note>. Some of the fragments confirm the belief that the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Attius.</note>love-motive was prominent<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO">Eur. fr. 160, 161, 162 (Nauck)</bibl>. The most significant is fr. 161, probably spoken by Haemon:—<quote lang="greek">ἤρων· τὸ μαίνεσθαι δ’ ἄρ’ ἦν ἔρως βροτοῖς</quote>.—Another very suggestive fragment is no. 176, where the speaker is evidently remonstrating with Creon:— ‘Who shall pain a rock by thrusting at it with a spear? And who can pain the dead by dishonour, if we grant that they have no sense of suffering?’ This is characteristic of the difference between the poets. Sophocles never urges the <emph>futility</emph> of Creon's vengeance, though he does touch upon its ignobleness (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1030" valid="yes">v. 1030</bibl>).</note>.

Statius, in<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Statius.</note> his epic <title>Thebaid</title>, departs widely from the Attic version of the story. Argeia, the widow of Polyneices, meets Antigone by night at the corpse. Each, unknown to the other, has come to do the same task; both are put to death by Creon,— <quote lang="la">;ambae hilares et mortis amore superbae</quote><note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Stat. Theb. 12.679">Stat. <title>Theb.</title> 12. 679</bibl>.</note>. This rapturous welcoming of death is, as we have seen, quite in the manner of Massinger and Alfieri, but not at all in that of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Alfieri's <title>Antigone</title> (published in <date authname="1783" value="1783">1783</date>) follows Statius in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Alfieri.</note> associating Argeia with Antigone; besides whom there are only two other actors, Creon and Haemon. The Italian poet has not improved upon the Greek. There are here two heroines, with very similar parts, in performing which they naturally utter very similar sentiments. Then Alfieri's Creon is not merely a perverse despot of narrow vision, but a monster of wickedness, who, by a thought worthy of Count Cenci, has published the edict for the express purpose of enticing Antigone into a breach of it. Having doomed her to die, he then offers to pardon her, if she will marry his son (and so unite the royal line with his own); but Antigone, though she esteems Haemon, declines to marry the son of such a parent. So she is put to death, while Argeia is sent back to Argos; and Haemon kills himself. It is not altogether unprofitable to be reminded, by such examples, what the theme of Sophocles could become in other hands.

Baumeister reproduces two vase-paintings, both curious<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Denkmäler</title>, pp. 83 f.</note>. The first<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ">From Gerhard, <title>Ant.

This is explained as a comic parody of Antigone's story; she has sent an old servant to perform the task in her stead, and he, when confronted with Creon, drops his disguise. The other vase-painting<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO"><title>Mon. Inst.</title> X. 27.</bibl></note>,—of perhaps <dateRange authname="-380/-300" from="-380" to="-300">c. 380-300 B.C.</dateRange>,—represents Heracles interceding with Creon, who is on the hero's right hand, while Antigone and Haemon are on his left. Eurydicè, Ismene, and a youth (perhaps Maion, the offspring of Antigone's marriage with Haemon) are also present. Klügmann<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><title>Ann. Inst.</title> 176, 1876.</note> refers this picture to the lost play of Euripides. Heydemann<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See footnote above, p. xxxviii, note 1 (3rd paragraph).</note> (with more probability, I think) supposes it to represent a scene from an otherwise unknown drama, of which he recognises the plot in Hyginus (<bibl default="NO" n="Hyg. Fab. 72"><title>Fab.</title> 72</bibl>). It is briefly this:—Haemon has disobeyed Creon by saving Antigone's life; Heracles intercedes with Creon for Haemon, but in vain; and the two lovers commit suicide. Professor Rhousopoulos, of Athens, in a letter to the French Academy<note anchored="yes" n="4" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">Περὶ εἰκόνος Ἀντιγόνης κατὰ ἀρχαῖον ὄστρακον, μετὰ ἀπεικονίσματος</quote>. I am indebted to the kindness of Professor D'Ooge, late Director of the American School at Athens, for an opportunity of seeing this letter.</note> (<date authname="1885" value="1885">1885</date>), describes a small fragment of a ceramic vase or cup, which he believes to have been painted in Attica, about <dateRange authname="-400/-350" from="-400" to="-350">400-350 B.C.</dateRange>, by (or after) a good artist. The fragment shows the beautiful face of a maiden,—the eyes bent earnestly on some object which lies before her. This object has perished with the rest of the vase. But the letters <quote lang="greek">ΕΙΚΗΣ</quote> remain; and it is certain that the body of Polyneices was the sight on which the maiden was gazing. As Prof. Rhousopoulos ingeniously shows, the body must have been depicted as resting on sloping ground,— the lowest slope, we may suppose, of the hill upon which the guards sat (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 411" valid="yes">v. 411</bibl>). The moment imagined by the artist may have been that at which Antigone returned, to find that the body had been again stripped of dust (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 426" valid="yes">v. 426</bibl>). The women of ancient Thebes are said to have been distinguished for stature no less than beauty; and the artist of the vase appears to have given Antigone both characteristics.

	<span class="line-ref">Line 18</span><p>It is not however, in the form of painting or of sculpture that Art has furnished the <title>Antigone</title> with its most famous and most delightful illustration. Two generations have now been so accustomed to associate this play with the music of Mendelssohn that at least a passing notice is due to<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Mendelssohn.</note> the circumstances under which that music was composed; circumstances which, at a distance of nearly half a century, possess a peculiar interest of their own for these later days of classical revivals. After Frederick William IV. had come to the Prussian throne in <date authname="1840-06" value="1840-6-">June, 1840</date>, one of his first acts was to found at Berlin the Academy of Arts for Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and Music; Mendelssohn, who was then thirty-two, became the first Director of the department of Music, in the spring of <date authname="1841" value="1841">1841</date>. The King had conceived the wish to revive some of the masterpieces of Greek Tragedy,— a project which the versatile poet Tieck, then on the confines of old age, encouraged warmly; none the less so, it would seem, because his own youth had been so vigorously identified with the protests of the Romantic school against classical restraint. Donner had recently published his German translation of Sophocles, ‘in the metres of the original,’ and the <title>Antigone</title> was chosen for the experiment. Mendelssohn accepted with enthusiasm the task of writing the music. The rapidity with which he worked may be estimated from the fact that <date authname="1841-09-09" value="1841-09-09">Sept. 9, 1841</date>, seems to have been about the date at which Tieck first broached the idea to him, and that the first full stage rehearsal took place some six weeks later,—on <date authname="1841-10-22" value="1841-10-22">October 22nd</date>. The success of the music in Germany seems to have been immediate and great; rather more than could be said of the first performance in London, when the <title>Antigone</title>, with the new music, was brought out at Covent Garden, on <date authname="1845-01-02" value="1845-01-02">Jan. 2, 1845</date>. The orchestra on that occasion, indeed, had a conductor no less able than the late Sir G Macfarren; but the Chorus was put on the stage in a manner of which a graphic memorial has been preserved to us<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">On <date authname="1845-03-25" value="1845-03-25">March 25, 1845</date>, Mendelssohn wrote to his sister:—‘See if you cannot find <title>Punch</title> for <date authname="1845-01-18" value="1845-01-18">Jan. 18 [1845]</date>. It contains an account of Antigone at Covent Garden, with illustrations,—especially a view of the Chorus which has made me laugh for three days.’ In his excellent article on Mendelssohn in the <title>Dictionary of Music</title>, Sir G. Grove has justly deemed this picture worthy of reproduction.</note>. It may be added that the Covent Garden stage-manager improved the opportunity of the joyous ‘dance-song’ to Dionysus (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1115" valid="yes">vv. 1115-1154</bibl>) by introducing a regular ballet.</p>
<p>To most lovers of music Mendelssohn's <title>Antigone</title> is too familiar to permit any word of comment here; but it may perhaps be less superfluous to remark a fact which has been brought under the writer's notice by an accomplished scholar<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Mr George Wotherspoon, who has practically demonstrated the point by setting the Greek words to the music for the Parodos (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 100" valid="yes">vv. 100-161</bibl>). It is only in the last antistrophe, he observes, that the ‘phrasing’ becomes distinctly modern, and less attentive to the Greek rhythms than to harmonic effects.</note>. For the most part, the music admits of having the Greek words set to it in a way which shows that Mendelssohn, while writing for Donner's words, must have been guided by something more than Donner's imitation of the Greek metres; he must also have been attentive, as a general rule, to the Greek text.

	<span class="line-ref">Line 19</span><p>The question as to the date <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Date of the play.</note> of the <title>Antigone</title> has a biographical no less than a literary interest. It is probable that the play was first produced at the Great Dionysia towards the end of <date authname="-441-03" value="-441-03">March, 441 B.C.</date> This precise date is, indeed, by no means certain; but all the evidence indicates that, at any rate, the years <dateRange authname="-442/-441" from="-442" to="-441">442 and 441 B.C.</dateRange> give the probable limits. According to the author of the <ref targOrder="U" target="hyp1">first Argument</ref> to the play, the success of the <title>Antigone</title> had led to Sophocles obtaining the office of general, which he held in an expedition against Samos.  Athens sent two expeditions to Samos in <date authname="-440" value="-440">440 B.C.</date> (1) The occasion of the first expedition was as follows. Samos and Miletus had been at war for the possession of Prienè, a place on the mainland not far from Miletus. The Milesians, having been worsted, denounced the Samians to the Athenians; who required that both parties should submit their case at Athens. This the Samians refused to do. The Athenians then sent forty ships to Samos,—put down the oligarchy there,—and established a democracy in its place<note anchored="yes" n="3" place="foot" resp="RCJ">The Greek life of Sophocles says that he served as general ‘in the war against the Anaeans’ (<quote lang="greek">ἀναίους</quote>). Anaea was a place on the mainland, near Prienè. Boeckh supposes that the first expedition was known as ‘the Anaean war,’ and that Sophocles took part in it as well as in the second expedition. To me, I confess, there seems to be far more probability in the simple supposition that <quote lang="greek">ἀναίους</quote> is a corruption of <quote lang="greek">σαμίους</quote>.</note>. (2) The second expedition had to deal with Samos in open rebellion. The Samian oligarchs had come back,—overthrown the new democracy,—and proclaimed a revolt from Athens, in which Byzantium joined. Pericles was one of the ten generals for the year. He sailed at once to Samos, with sixty ships. All his nine colleagues went with him. When they reached Samos, sixteen of the sixty ships were detached on special service,—partly to watch the Carian coast, partly to summon aid from the two great islands to the<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The strategia of Sophocles.</note> north, Chios and Lesbos. Sophocles, who was one of the ten generals, was sent on the mission to these islands.</p>
<p>‘I met Sophocles, the poet, at Chios, when he was sailing as general to Lesbos.’ These are the words of  Ion, the poet and prose-writer—who was only some twelve years younger than Sophocles—in a fragment preserved by Athenaeus<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">p. 603 <bibl default="NO">E. Miller, <title>Frag. Hist.</title> II. 46.</bibl></note>. The occasion of the meeting was a dinner given to Sophocles at Chios by Hermesilaus, a friend of his who acted as Athenian ‘proxenus’ there. Now, there is not the smallest real ground for questioning the genuineness of this fragment<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">Arguments against the genuineness have been brought, indeed, by  Ritter  Fr.(<bibl default="NO"><title lang="de">Vorgebliche Strategie d. Sophokles gegen Samos:</title> Rhein. Mus., 1843, pp. 187 ff.</bibl>). (1) Ion represents Sophocles as saying,—<quote lang="greek">Περικλῆς ποιεῖν με ἔφη, στρατηγεῖν δ’ οὐκ ἐπίστασθαι</quote>. Sophocles (Ritter argues) would have said <quote lang="greek">φησί</quote>, not <quote lang="greek">ἔφη</quote>, if Pericles had been alive. The forger of the fragment intended it to refer to the revolt of Lesbos in <date authname="-428" value="-428">428 B.C.</date>,—forgetting that Sophocles would then be 78. But we reply:—The tense, <quote lang="greek">ἔφη</quote>, can obviously refer to the particular occasion on which the remark was made: ‘Pericles <emph>said</emph> so [when I was appointed, or when we were at Samos together].’ (2) Ion says of Sophocles, <quote lang="greek">οὐ ῥεκτήριος ἦν</quote>. This (says Ritter) implies that Sophocles was dead; who, however, long survived Ion. [Ion was dead in <date authname="-421" value="-421">421 B.C.</date>, <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Peace 835" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title> 835</bibl>.] But here, again, the tense merely refers to the time at which the writer received the impression. We could say of a living person, ‘he was an agreeable man’—meaning that we found him so when we met him.</note>. And its genuineness is confirmed by internal evidence. Sophocles said at the dinner-party,—alluding to a playful <emph>ruse</emph> by which he had amused the company,—that he was practising generalship, as Pericles had said that he was a better poet than general. The diplomatic mission to Chios and Lesbos was a service in which Pericles might very naturally utilize the abilities of his gifted, though unmilitary colleague. There is another trait which has not (to my knowledge) been noticed, but which seems worth remarking, as the coincidence is one which is not likely to have been contrived by a forger. It is casually mentioned that, at this dinner-party, an attendant was standing ‘near the fire,’ and the couch of Sophocles, the chief guest, was also near it. The warm season, then, had not begun. Now we know that Pericles sailed for Samos early in 440 B.C., before the regular season for navigation had yet opened<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Curtius, <title>Hist. Gr.</title> II. 472 (Eng. tr.).</note>.</p>
<p>If the fragment of Ion is authentic, then it is certain that Sophocles held the strategia, and certain also that he held it in <date authname="-440" value="-440">440 B.C.</date>: for Ion's mention of Lesbos cannot possibly be referred to the revolt of that island from Athens in <date authname="-428" value="-428">428 B.C.</date>  Apart from the fragment of  Ion, however, there is good Attic authority for the tradition. Androtion, whose <title>Atthis</title> was written about <date authname="-280" value="-280">280 B.C.</date>, gave the names of the ten generals at Samos on this occasion. His list<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">This fragment of Androtion has been preserved by the schol. on Aristeides, vol. 3, p. 485 (Dind.). Müller, <title>Frag. Hist.</title> IV. 645. The names of two of the ten generals are wanting in the printed texts, but have since been restored, from the MS., by Wilamowitz, <title>De Rhesi Scholiis</title>, P. 13 (Greifswald, 1877). I have observed a remarkable fact in regard to Androtion's list, which ought to be mentioned, because it might be urged against the authenticity of the list, though (in my opinion) such an inference from it would be unfair. Androtion gives (1) the names, (2) the demes of the Generals, but <emph>not</emph> their tribes. The regular order of precedence for the ten Cleisthenean tribes was this:— 1. Erectheis. 2. Aegeis. 3. Pandionis. 4. Leontis. 5. Acamantis. 6. Oeneis. 7. Cecropis. 8. Hippothontis. 9. Aeantis. 10. Antiochis. Now take the demes named by Androtion. His list will be found to follow this order of the ten tribes,— with one exception, and it is in the case of Sophocles. His deme, Colonus, belonged to the Antiochis, and therefore his name ought to have come last. But Androtion puts it second. The explanation is simple. When the ten tribes were increased to twelve, by the addition of the Antigonis and Demetrias (in or about <date authname="-307" value="-307">307 B.C.</date>), some of the demes were transferred from one tribe to another. Among these was the deme of Colonus. It was transferred from the Antiochis, the tenth on the roll, to the Aegeis, the second on the roll. Hence Androtion's order is correct for his own time (<date authname="-280" value="-280">c. 280 B.C.</date>), but not correct for <date authname="-440" value="-440">440 B.C.</date>  It is quite unnecessary, however, to infer that he invented or doctored the list. It is enough to suppose that he re-adjusted the order, so as to make it consistent in the eyes of his contemporaries.</note> includes Pericles, and ‘Sophocles, the poet, of Colonus.’</p>

It says;—‘They say (<quote lang="greek">φασί</quote>) that Sophocles was appointed to the strategia which he held at Samos, because he had distinguished himself by the production of the <title>Antigone.</title>’ Here, as so often elsewhere, the phrase, ‘they say,’ is not an expression of doubt, but an indication that the story was found in several writers. We know the names of at least two writers in whose works such a tradition would have been likely to occur. One of them is Satyrus (<date authname="-200" value="-200">c. 200 B.C.</date>), whose collection of biographies was used by the author of the Life of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Oed. Col.</title>, § 18, p. xli. J. S. III.3</note>; the other—also quoted in the Life—is Carystius of Pergamum, who lived about <date authname="-110" value="-110">110 B.C.</date>, and wrote a book, <quote lang="greek">Περὶ διδασκαλιῶν</quote>—‘Chronicles of the Stage’—which Athenaeus cites. At the time when these works —and there were others of a similar kind—were compiled, old and authentic lists of Athenian plays, with their dates, appear to have been extant in such libraries as those of Alexandria and Pergamum. When, therefore, we meet with a tradition,—dating at least from <dateRange authname="-200/-100" from="-200" to="-100">the second century B.C.</dateRange>,—which affirms that the strategia of Sophocles was due to his <title>Antigone</title>, one inference, at least, is fairly secure. We may believe that the <title>Antigone</title> was known to have been produced earlier than the summer of <date authname="-441" value="-441">441 B.C.</date> For, if Sophocles was strategus in the early spring of <date authname="-440" value="-440">440 B.C.</date>, he must have been elected in <date authname="-441-05" value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date> The election of the ten strategi was held annually, at the same time as the other official elections (<quote lang="greek">ἀρχαιρεσίαι</quote>), in the month of Thargelion, at the beginning of the ninth prytany of the civic year. Further, we may conclude that the <title>Antigone</title> had not been produced at any long interval before <date authname="-441-05" value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date> Otherwise the tradition that the play had influenced the election—whether it really did so or not—would not have seemed probable.</p>
	<p>Assuming, then, that the <title>Antigone</title> was brought out not long before Sophocles obtained the strategia, we have still to consider whether there is any likelihood in the story that his election was influenced by the success of the play. At first sight, a modern reader is apt to be reminded of the man of letters who, in the opinion of his admirer, would have been competent, at the shortest notice, to assume command of the Channel Fleet. It may appear grotesque that an important State should have rewarded poetical genius by a similar appointment. But here, as in other cases, we must endeavour to place ourselves at the old Athenian point of view. The word ‘general,’ by which we render ‘strategus,’ suggests functions purely military, requiring, for their proper discharge, an elaborate professional training. Such a conception of the Athenian strategia would not, however, be accurate. The ten strategi, chosen annually, formed a board of which the duties were primarily military, but also, in part, civil. And, for the majority of the ten, the military duties were usually restricted to the exercise of control and supervision at Athens. They resembled officials at the War Office, with some added functions from the province of the Home Office. The number of strategi sent out with an army or a fleet was, at this period, seldom more than three. It was only in grave emergencies that all the ten strategi went on active service together. In <date authname="-441-05" value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date>,—the time, as it seems, when Sophocles was elected,—no one could have foreseen the great crisis at Samos. In an ordinary year Sophocles, as one of the strategi, would not necessarily have been required to leave Athens. Among his nine colleagues there were doubtless, besides Pericles, one or two more possessed of military aptitudes, who would have sufficed to perform any ordinary service in the field. Demosthenes—in whose day only one of the ten strategi was ordinarily commissioned for war—describes the other nine as occupied, among other things, with arranging the processions for the great religious festivals at Athens<note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ"><bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 4.26" valid="yes">Dem. or. 4 § 26</bibl>.</note>. He deplores, indeed, that they should be so employed; but it is certain that it had long been one duty of these high officials to help in organising the great ceremonies. We are reminded how suitable such a sphere of duty would have been for Sophocles,—who is said to have led in his boyhood the Chorus that celebrated the victory of Salamis,—and we seem to win a new light on the meaning of his appointment to the strategia. In so far as a strategus had to do with public ceremonies and festivals, a man with the personal gifts of Sophocles could hardly have strengthened his claim better than by a brilliant success at the Dionysia. The mode of election was favourable to such a man. It was by show of hands in the Ecclesia. If the <title>Antigone</title> was produced at the Great Dionysia, late in <date authname="-441-03" value="-441-03">March, 441 B.C.</date>, it is perfectly intelligible that the poet's splendid dramatic triumph should have contributed to his election in the following May. It is needless to suppose that his special fitness for the office was suggested to his fellow-citizens by the special maxims of administration which he ascribes to Creon,—a notion which would give an air of unreality,—verging, indeed, on comedy,—to a result which appears entirely natural when it is considered in a larger way<note anchored="yes" n="2" place="foot" resp="RCJ">One of Aelian's anecdotes (<title>Var. Hist.</title> 3. 8) is entitled, <quote lang="greek">ὅτι ὁ Φρύνιχος διά τι ποίημα στρατηγὸς ᾑρέθη</quote>. Phrynichus, he says, ‘having composed suitable songs for the performers of the war-dance (<quote lang="greek">πυρριχισταῖς</quote>) in a tragedy, so captivated and enraptured the (Athenian) spectators, that they immediately elected him to a military command.’ Nothing else is known concerning this alleged strategia. It is possible that Phrynichus, the tragic poet of <date authname="-500" value="-500">c. 500 B.C.</date>, was confounded by some later anecdote-monger with the son of Stratonides, general in <date authname="-412" value="-412">412 B.C.</date> (<bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 8.25" valid="yes">Thuc. 8.25</bibl>), and that the story was suggested by the authentic strategia of Sophocles. At any rate, the vague and dubious testimony of Aelian certainly does not warrant us in using the case of Phrynichus as an illustration.</note>.

Certain traits of composition distinguish it. (1) The division of an iambic trimeter between two or more speakers—technically called <quote lang="greek">ἀντιλαβή</quote>—is avoided, as it is by Aeschylus. It is admitted in the other six plays. (2) An anapaest nowhere holds the first place of the trimeter. It may further be noticed that the resolution of any foot of the trimeter is comparatively rare in the <title>Antigone.</title> Including the proper names, there are less than 40 instances. A considerably higher proportion is found in later plays. (3) The use made of anapaestic verse is archaistic in three points. (<emph>a</emph>) The Parodos contains regular anapaestic systems (see note on <ref targOrder="U" target="cl100">vv. 100-161</ref>). (<emph>b</emph>) The Chorus uses anapaests in announcing the entrance of Creon, Antigone, Ismene, Haemon. In the case of Ismene, these anapaests do not follow the stasimon, but occur in the midst of the epeisodion (see <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 526" valid="yes">vv. 526-530</bibl>). (<emph>c</emph>) Anapaests are also admitted, for purposes of dialogue, within an epeisodion (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 929" valid="yes">vv. 929-943</bibl>, where the Chorus, Creon, and Antigone are the speakers). Aeschylus allowed this; but elsewhere it occurs only in the <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles (another comparatively early play), and in the <title>Medea</title> of Euripides (<date authname="-431" value="-431">431 B.C.</date>).

Bergk (<title>Hist. Gr. Lit.</title> III. p. 414) proposes to read, <quote lang="greek">δεδίδακται δὲ τὸ δρᾶμα τοῦτο τριακοστόν· δεύτερος ἦν</quote>. He assumes that Sophocles gained the second prize, because, according to the Parian Chronicle (60), the first prize was gained by Euripides in the archonship of Diphilus (<dateRange authname="-442-08/-441-07" from="-442-08" to="-441-07">442/1 B.C.</dateRange>). He adds that the word <quote lang="greek">εὐδοκιμήσαντα</quote>, applied to Sophocles in the Argument, would suit the winner of the second prize,—as Aristophanes says of his own <quote lang="greek">Δαιταλεῖς</quote>, which gained the second prize, <cit><quote lang="greek">ἄριστ’ ἠκουσάτην</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Cl. 529" valid="yes">（<title>Nub.</title> 529)</bibl></cit>. But two things are wanting to the probability of Bergk's conjecture, viz., (1) some independent reason for thinking that the <title>Antigone</title> was the 30th, rather than the 32nd, of its author's works; and (2) some better ground for assuming that it gained the second prize.</note>.’ This statement was doubtless taken from authentic <quote lang="greek">διδασκαλίαι</quote>—lists of performances, with their dates—which had come down from the 5th century B.C. to the Alexandrian age. The notice has a larger biographical interest than can often be claimed for such details. In <date authname="-441" value="-441">441 B.C.</date> Sophocles was fifty-five: he died in <dateRange authname="-406-08/-405-07" from="-406-08" to="-405-07">406/5 B.C.</dateRange>, at ninety or ninety-one. More than 100 lost plays of his are known by name: the total number of his works might be roughly estimated at 110. It appears warrantable to assume that Sophocles had produced his works by tetralogies,—i.e., three tragedies and one satyric drama on each occasion. If the number 32 includes the satyric dramas, then the <title>Antigone</title> was the fourth play of the eighth tetralogy, and Sophocles would have competed on seven occasions <dateRange authname="-468/-441" from="-468" to="-441">before 441 B.C.</dateRange> He is recorded to have gained the first prize at his first appearance, in <date authname="-468" value="-468">468 B.C.</date>, when he was twenty-eight. The production of 28 plays in the next 27 years would certainly argue a fair measure of poetical activity. If, on the other hand, this 32 is exclusive of satyric dramas, then the <title>Antigone</title> was the second play of the eleventh trilogy, and the whole number of plays written by the poet from 468 to 441 B.C. (both years included) was 44.</p>
<p>On either view, then, we have this interesting result,—that the years of the poet's life from fifty-five to ninety were decidedly more productive than the years from twenty-eight to fifty-five. And if we suppose that the number 32 includes the satyric dramas—which seems the more natural view—then the ratio of increased fertility after the age of fifty-five becomes still more remarkable. We have excellent reason, moreover, for believing that this increase in amount of production was not attended by any deterioration of quality. The <title>Philoctetes</title> and the <title>Coloneus</title> are probably among the latest works of all. These facts entitle Sophocles to be reckoned among the most memorable instances of poetical genius prolonging its fullest vigour to extreme old age, and—what is perhaps rarer still—actually increasing its activity after middle life had been left behind.

<span class="line-ref">Line 23</span><p>Nothing is known as to the plays which Sophocles<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Theban plays—not a connected trilogy.</note> may have produced along with the <title>Antigone.</title> Two forms of trilogy were in concurrent use down at least to the end of the fifth century,—that in which the three tragedies were parts of one story,—and that in which no such link existed. The former was usually (though doubtless not always) employed by Aeschylus; the latter was preferred by his younger rival. Thus it is possible,—nay, probable,—that the two tragedies which accompanied the <title>Antigone</title> were unrelated to it in subject. Even when the Theban plays of Sophocles are read in the order of the fable, they do not form a linked trilogy in the Aeschylean sense. This is not due merely to discrepancy of detail or incompleteness of juncture. The perversely rigorous Creon of the <title>Antigone</title> is, indeed, an essentially distinct character from the ruthless villain of the <title>Coloneus;</title> the <title>Coloneus</title> describes the end of Oedipus in a manner irreconcileable with the allusion in the <title>Antigone</title> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

But, if such differences existed between the <title>Choephori</title> and the <title>Eumenides</title>, they would not affect the solidarity of the ‘Oresteia.’ On the other hand, it does not suffice to make the triad a compact trilogy that the <title>Tyrannus</title> is, in certain aspects, supplemented by the <title>Coloneus</title><note anchored="yes" n="1" place="foot" resp="RCJ">See Introd. to <title>Oed.

In nothing is the art of Sophocles more characteristically seen than in the fact that each of these three masterpieces—with their common thread of fable, and with all their particular affinities—is still, dramatically and morally, an independent whole.

For this order it may be said, that a tribrach contained in one word forms the second foot in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Also, <quote lang="greek">ἄταφον</quote> thus gains a certain abrupt force, and the order corresponds with <quote lang="greek">καλύψαι...κωκῦσαι</quote>. But against it we may urge:—(1) The other order was the usual one: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

(2) On such a question of order no great weight belongs to L, in which wrong transpositions of words certainly occur; e.g.  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 156" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 156</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1332" valid="yes"> Ph. 1332</bibl>: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1088" valid="yes"><title>O.

There is no ground for distinguishing <quote lang="greek">ἄκλαυστος</quote>, as ‘not to be wept,’ from <quote lang="greek">ἄκλαυτος</quote>, ‘not wept’ (see <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 361" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 361</bibl> note in Appendix on <quote lang="greek">γνωτός</quote> and <quote lang="greek">γνωστός</quote>).

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πρὸς χάριν</lemma> is used either adverbially or with a genitive. (1) As an adverb, it means literally, ‘with a view to gratification’: hence (<emph>a</emph>) when the <quote lang="greek">χάρις</quote> is one's own, ‘<emph>at pleasure</emph>,’ as Philoctetes calls the birds ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Creon's edict, addressed to all Thebans, touches the sisters first, since, as the nearest relatives of the dead, they were most concerned to see that he received burial. Antigone speaks with burning indignation. She says, in effect:—‘Thus hath Creon forbidden thee and me to render the last offices to our brother.’ The parenthesis <quote lang="greek">λέγω γὰρ κἀμέ</quote> is prompted by the intense consciousness of a resolve. To her, who knows her own heart, it seems wonderful that Creon should even have imagined her capable of obeying such an edict. It is a fine psychological touch, and one of the most pathetic in the play.</p>

On the other hand cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 8.24" valid="yes">Dem. or. 8 § 24</bibl> <quote lang="greek">παρ’ ὧν ἂν ἕκαστοι δύνωνται, τούτων τῶν τὴν Ἀσίαν ἐνοικούντων λέγω, χρήματα λαμβάνουσιν</quote></cit>:  Aesch. fr. 169 <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ Ἀντικλείας ἆσσον ἦλθε Σίσυφος, | τῆς σῆς λέγω τοι μητρός</quote>.

<p>Two other explanations may be noticed. Both make <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοι</lemma> enclitic. (1) Taking <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοι</lemma> as ethic dat. with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοιαῦτα</lemma>: ‘There is the good Creon's proclamation for you,—aye, and for <emph>me</emph> too, for I count myself also amongst those forbidden’ (Campbell). Thus <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κἀμοί</lemma> is not, like <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοι</lemma>, a mere ethic dat., but rather a dat. of interest. Such a transition seems hardly possible. (2) Taking <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">σοι</lemma> as ethic dat. with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγαθόν</lemma>: ‘your good Creon, aye and mine, for I own I too thought him so’ (Kennedy). But Antigone is too much occupied with the edict itself to dwell with such emphasis at such a moment on the disappointment which she has experienced as to Creon's amiability.

<span class="line-ref">Line 45</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν γοῦν ἐμὸν</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">κ.τ.λ.</foreign> To the question—‘Do you really mean to bury him?’—the simple answer would have been, <quote lang="greek">τὸν γοῦν ἐμὸν ἀδελφόν</quote>, ‘I certainly mean to bury my own brother.’ But the word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐμόν</lemma>—reminding her that he is equally <title>Ismene's</title> brother—prompts the insertion of the reproachful clause, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καὶ τὸν σόν, ἢν σὺ μὴ θέλῃς</lemma>. Thus the contrast between <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν ἐμόν</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν σόν</lemma> anticipates the emphasis on the word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀδελφόν</lemma>. The whole thought is,—‘I will certainly do <emph>my</emph> duty,—and <emph>thine</emph>, if thou wilt not,—to a <emph>brother.</emph>’ Since <quote lang="greek">ὁ ἐμός</quote> is the same person as <quote lang="greek">ὁ σός</quote>, this thought can be poetically expressed by saying, ‘I will certainly bury <emph>my</emph> brother,—and <emph>thine</emph>, if thou wilt not’: for the tribute <emph>rendered</emph> to him by one sister represents the tribute <emph>due</emph> from both. Remark that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γοῦν</lemma> often emphasises a pers. or possessive pron. (as here <quote lang="greek">ἐμόν</quote>): 565 <quote lang="greek">σοὶ γοῦν</quote>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 527" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 527</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πρὸς γοῦν ἐμοῦ</quote></cit>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 626" valid="yes"><title>O.

El. 1499" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 1499</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τὰ γοῦν ς</quote></cit>'.— Two other versions are possible, but less good. (1) Taking <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν … ἐμὸν καὶ τὸν σόν</lemma> as=‘him who is my brother and thine,’ and <quote lang="greek">ἢν</quote> as=‘<emph>even</emph> if.’ But for this we should expect <quote lang="greek">τὸν γοῦν ἐμόν τε καὶ σόν</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">κἄν</quote>. (2) Taking <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καὶ</lemma> with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἤν</lemma>, ‘I will bury my brother, even if thou wilt not bury thine.’ But (i) the separation of <quote lang="greek">καί</quote> from <quote lang="greek">ἤν</quote> is abnormal: (ii) the mode of expression would be scarcely natural unless <quote lang="greek">ὁ ἐμός</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ὁ σός</quote> were different persons.

Didymus (circ. 30 B.C.) said this verse was condemned as spurious ‘by the commentators’ (<quote lang="greek">ὑπὸ τῶν ὑπομνηματιστῶν</quote>). I believe it to be undoubtedly genuine. One modern argument against it is that Antigone should here speak only one verse. But these two verses express the resolve on which the action of the play turns: it is an important moment in the dialogue. And, at such a moment,  Soph. often allows a stichomuthia to be broken by two or more verses for the same speaker. See the stichomuthia in 401—406, broken by 404 f.: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὐτοκτονοῦντε</lemma> is not literally, ‘slaying themselves,’ or ‘slaying each other,’ but, ‘slaying with their own hands’: the context explains that the person whom each so slew was his own brother. So either (1) <emph>suicide</emph>, or (2) <emph>slaying of kinsfolk</emph>, can be expressed by <quote lang="greek">αὐθέντης, αὐτοκτόνος, αὐτοσφαγής, αὐτοφόνος</quote>, etc. The compound merely expresses that the deed is done with one's own hand, implying that such a use of one's own hand is unnatural. <emph>The</emph> object of the deed may be one's own life, or another's. This ambiguity of the compound is illustrated by 1175 f. <quote lang="greek">αὐτόχειρ δ’ αἱμάσσεται</quote>.—XO. <quote lang="greek">πότερα πατρῴας ἢ πρὸς οἰκείας χερός</quote>; ‘by his father's hand, or by his own?’

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπαλλήλοιν χεροῖν</lemma>, ‘with mutual hands,’—each brother lifting his hands against the other. It is hard to believe that  Soph. would here have written <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοιν</lemma>, ‘against each other,’ when <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χεροῖν</lemma> would seem a weak addition, and the double <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οιν</lemma> would be brought into harsh relief by the independence of the two words. The verse is in every way better if we can read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπαλλήλοιν</lemma> as an epithet of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χεροῖν</lemma>. Now we know that the word <quote lang="greek">ἐπάλληλος</quote> was in common use at least as early as the 2nd century B.C. In the extant literature it seems always to correspond with <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοις</quote> as=‘<emph>one on top of another</emph>’ (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 23.47" valid="yes"><title>Od.</title> 23.47</bibl> <quote lang="greek">κείατ’ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοισι</quote></cit>), being used to mean, ‘in close order’ or ‘in rapid sequence’ (as Polyb. 11. 11 <quote lang="greek">ἐν ἐπαλλήλοις τάξεσι</quote>, in close ranks: Alciphro <title>Epp.</title> 3. 6 <quote lang="greek">τὰς ἐπαλλήλους πληγάς</quote>, the showers of blows). An exception might, indeed, be supposed in Philo Judaeus <title>De Mose</title> 3, p. 692, where he is saying that the continuity of human record has been broken <quote lang="greek">διὰ τὰς ἐν ὕδασι καὶ πυρὶ γενομένας συνεχεῖς καὶ ἐπαλλήλους φθοράς</quote>: which Adrian Turnebus rendered, <quote lang="la">propter illas eluvionum et exustionum continuas et <emph>alternas</emph> (‘mutual’) interneciones.</quote> But Philo was evidently (I think) using <quote lang="greek">ἐπάλληλος</quote> in its ordinary sense, and meant merely, ‘owing to <emph>the continuous and rapid succession</emph> of calamities by flood and fire.’ It by no means follows, however, that a poet of the 5th cent. B.C. could not have used <quote lang="greek">ἐπάλληλος</quote> in a sense corresponding with <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοις</quote> as= ‘<emph>against</emph> each other,’—the more frequent and familiar sense of the words, as in the Homeric <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοισιν ἰόντες, ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοισι φέρον πολύδακρυν Ἄρηα</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

The use of <quote lang="greek">ἐπάλληλος</quote> here may have been partly prompted by a reminiscence of <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

Cp.

<span class="line-ref">Line 94</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐχθρὰ...τῷ θανόντι προσκείσει δίκῃ</lemma>, ‘thou wilt be subject to the lasting enmity of the dead.’ The word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">προσκείσει</lemma> means literally, ‘<emph>wilt be attached to</emph>...,’ i.e., ‘<emph>wilt be brought into a lasting relation with</emph>’; and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐχθρά</lemma> defines the nature of that relation. The sense is thus virtually the same as if we had, <quote lang="greek">ὁ θανὼν ἐχθρός σοι προσκείσεται</quote>, ‘the enmity of the dead will cleave to thee.’ The convertible use of <quote lang="greek">προσκεῖσεθαι</quote> is illustrated by 1243 <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρὶ πρόσκειται κακόν</quote>, as compared with <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Here, <quote lang="greek">προσκείσει</quote> expresses merely the establishment of the permanent relation between the two persons. It does not mean, ‘you will be brought, as his foe, <emph>into dependence</emph> on him’ (i.e. under the power of his curse); as in <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

Nor, again, ‘you will <emph>press upon</emph> the dead as his foe,’ i.e. be hostile and grievous to him: for, as <quote lang="greek">δίκῃ</quote> shows, the punishment is to be hers, not his. The idea might have been expressed in a converse form by <quote lang="greek">τὸν θανόντα ἐχθρὸν προσθήσει</quote> (cf. <bibl default="NO" n="Xen. Cyrop. 2.4.12" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Cyr.</title> 2.4.12</bibl>).</p>
<p>Lehrs proposed <quote lang="greek">Δίκῃ</quote>, i.e. ‘you will fall under the chastisement of justice.’ Donaldson, following Emper, reads <quote lang="greek">ἐχθρᾷ... δίκῃ</quote>, as <foreign lang="la">iure inimicorum apud mortuum eris</foreign>: i.e. on the part of the dead you will be deemed to have only the rights of a foe. This is impossible. The ordinary reading is sound.

The round shield, painted white, which the Argive soldier carried on his left arm, is the <quote lang="greek">λευκῆς χιόνος πτέρυξ</quote> of 114. The choice of <emph>white</emph> as the Argive colour may have been prompted by a popular association of <quote lang="greek">Ἄργος</quote> with <quote lang="greek">ἀργός</quote>.</p>
<p>The words <quote lang="greek">τὸν λεύκασπιν Ἀργόθεν</quote> answer metrically to 123 <quote lang="greek">πευκάενθ’ Ἥφαιστον ἑλεῖν</quote>. Instead of <quote lang="greek">Ἀργόθεν</quote> (¯˘¯) we therefore require ¯˘˘¯. The short final of <quote lang="greek">λεύκασπιν</quote> is legitimate, the metre being Glyconic (see  Analysis Metr.). In the antistrophic verse, the H of <quote lang="greek">Ἥφαιστον</quote> is ‘irrational,’ i.e. is a long syllable doing duty for a short: and Nauck is incorrect in saying that the metre ‘requires’ (though it admits) a choriambus beginning with a <emph>consonant.</emph> The simplest remedy is to read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἀργόθεν ἐκ | βάντα φῶτα</lemma>, and to suppose that, after the loss of <quote lang="greek">ἐκ, βάντα</quote> and <quote lang="greek">φῶτα</quote> were accidentally transposed. Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1088" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1088</bibl> where <quote lang="greek">σθένει ’πινικείῳ</quote> is certainly the right order, but the MSS. reverse it. (See also above on v. 29.) Dindorf reads <quote lang="greek">ἐκ φῶτα βάντα</quote>, assuming tmesis: but tmesis of <quote lang="greek">ἐκ</quote> in  Soph. occurs elsewhere only before <quote lang="greek">μέν</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1053" valid="yes"><title>Tr.</title> 1053</bibl>) or <quote lang="greek">δέ</quote>, and there was no motive here for interposing <quote lang="greek">φῶτα</quote>. Hermann reads <quote lang="greek">Ἀργόθεν ἔκ</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">ἐξ Ἀργόθεν</quote>: but elsewhere <quote lang="greek">ἐκ</quote> comes before, not after, such forms (<quote lang="greek">ἐξ Αἰσύμηθεν</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 8.304" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 8.304</bibl>: <quote lang="greek">ἐξ ἁλόθεν, ἐξ οὐρανόθεν</quote>, etc.). If <quote lang="greek">Ἀργόθεν</quote> is not genuine, then it was probably a gloss on some other form in <quote lang="greek">‐θεν</quote>. Had <quote lang="greek">γᾶς Πέλοπος</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">Δαναοῦ</quote>) been in the text, a scholiast would have been more apt to paraphrase with <quote lang="greek">ἀπ’</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἐξ Ἄργους</quote>. This is against such conjectures as <quote lang="greek">Ἀργέϊον, Ἀργογενῆ, Ἀργολικόν, Ἰναχίδαν, Ἰνάχιον</quote>, as is also the fact that <quote lang="greek">βάντα</quote> suggests a mention of ‘the place whence.’ <quote lang="greek">Ἀπιόθεν</quote> (Ahrens) would mean ‘from <quote lang="greek">Ἄπιος</quote>,’ but we require ‘from <quote lang="greek">Ἀπία</quote>’ <foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> (<quote lang="greek">γῆ</quote>, the Peloponnesus, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1303" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1303</bibl> n.), i.e. <quote lang="greek">Ἀπία—θεν</quote>: cp. <quote lang="greek">Ὀλυμπίαθεν</quote>. I had thought of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἰναχόθεν</lemma>, which Mekler, too, has suggested, though he has not supported it by argument. The points in its favour are: (<emph>a</emph>) the order <quote lang="greek">φῶτα βάντα</quote> can be kept: (<emph>b</emph>) after ‘Dircè's streams’ in v. 105 a reference to the Argive river would be appropriate: (<emph>c</emph>) <quote lang="greek">ἀργόθεν</quote> might have come in either as a gloss, or a corruption of the letters <quote lang="greek">αχόθεν</quote>, if <quote lang="greek">ιν</quote> had dropped out after <quote lang="greek">λεύκασπιν</quote>. But I hesitate to displace <quote lang="greek">Ἀργόθεν</quote>, esp. when a direct mention of Argos here so naturally corresponds with the direct mention of Thebes in v. 101.

<span class="line-ref">Line 110</span><p> The MSS. have <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὃν...Πολυνείκης</lemma>. If this were sound, it would be necessary to suppose that after <quote lang="greek">ἀμφιλόγων</quote> a dipodia has been lost, such as Nauck supplies by &lt;<quote lang="greek">ἤγαγεν· ἐχθρὸς δ’&gt; ὀξέα κλάζων</quote>. For (1) a verb is wanted to govern <quote lang="greek">ὅν</quote>, and (2) the description of the eagle, beginning with <quote lang="greek">ὀξέα κλάζων</quote>, clearly refers to the Argive host, not to Polyneices only. But if, with Scaliger, we read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὃς ...Πολυνείκους</lemma>, no such loss need be assumed. The correspondence between anapaestic systems is not always strict, and the monometer <quote lang="greek">ὀξέα κλάζων</quote> could stand here, though the anti-system has a dimeter in the same place (129). The MS. reading <quote lang="greek">ὃν...Πολυνείκης</quote> probably arose from a misunderstanding of the scholium:—<quote lang="greek">ὅντινα στρατὸν Ἀργείων, ἐξ ἀμφιλόγων νεικέων ἀρθείς, ἤγαγεν ὁ Πολυνείκης, οἷον ἀμφιλογίᾳ χρησάμενος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφόν· διὰ βραχέων δὲ εἶπεν αὐτό, ὡς γνωρίμου οὔσης τῆς ὑποθέσεως</quote>. The Schol. wrote <quote lang="greek">ἀρθείς</quote>, to agree with <quote lang="greek">Πολυνείκης</quote>, and not <quote lang="greek">ἀρθέντα</quote>, to agree with <quote lang="greek">στρατόν</quote>, because it suited the form of his paraphrase, <quote lang="greek">οἷον ἀμφιλογίᾳ χρησάμενος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφόν</quote>. By <quote lang="greek">διὰ βραχέων δὲ εἷπεν αὐτό</quote>, the Schol. meant not merely the indefiniteness of <quote lang="greek">νεικέων ἐξ ἀμφιλόγων</quote>, but also the compactness of <quote lang="greek">Πολυνείκους | ἀρθεὶς ἐκ νεικέων</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ὅντινα στρατὸν ἤγαγεν ὁ Πολυνείκης</quote>. But a transcriber, noticing that the Schol. joined <quote lang="greek">ἀρθείς</quote> with <quote lang="greek">Πολυνείκης</quote>, might easily infer that <quote lang="greek">ὃν...Πολυνείκης</quote> ought to stand in the text, and might take <quote lang="greek">διὰ βραχέων</quote> as meaning that the verb <quote lang="greek">ἤγαγε</quote> could be understood.—L has the Doric <quote lang="greek">γᾷ</quote>, and presently <quote lang="greek">γᾶν, ὑπερέπτα</quote>, which I keep: see Appendix.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 117</span><p> In <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στὰς δ’ ὑπὲρ μελάθρων</lemma> there is a momentary return to the image of the flying eagle,—‘having stayed his flight above my dwellings,’—before swooping. The words do not mean that the Argive army was posted on hills around Thebes: the only hills available were to the N. of the town. The <quote lang="greek">Ἰσμήνιος λόφος</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 9.10.2" valid="yes">Paus. 9.10.2</bibl>), on which Donaldson places the Argives, was merely a low eminence close to one of the <emph>city</emph> gates. Thebes stood on a low spur <emph>of</emph> ground projecting southward, and overlooking the plain. Sophocles has elsewhere described the Argive besiegers, with topographical correctness, as having ‘set their leaguer <emph>round the plain of Thebes</emph>’ (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1312" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1312</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τὸ Θήβης πεδίον ἀμφεστᾶσι πᾶν</quote></cit>). Struve's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πτάς</lemma> (a participle not found elsewhere except in composition with a preposition) seems improbable, and also less forcible.</p>
<p>The words <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">φονώσαισιν ἀμφιχανὼν... λόγχαις</lemma> once more merge the image of the eagle,—as at v. 115,—in literal description of a besieging army, save in so far as the figurative <quote lang="greek">ἀμφιχανών</quote> suggests a monster opening its jaws. The word was perh. suggested by <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 23.79" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 23.79</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἐμὲ μὲν κὴρ | ἀμφέχανε στυγερή</quote></cit> (hath gaped for me—i.e. ‘devoured me’).

Cl. 122" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Nub.</title> 122</bibl>): the two outside horses drew in traces (<quote lang="greek">σειραῖοι</quote>). The chariot went down the right-hand side of the course, turned sharply from right to left at the distance-post (<quote lang="greek">καμπτήρ, νύσσα</quote>), and came back down the left side. Hence, at the turning-point, the right-hand tracehorse had most work to do; and the best horse was put in that place. Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 721" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 721</bibl> (at the turning-post) <quote lang="greek">δεξιόν τ’ ἀνεὶς | σειραῖον ἵππον εἶργε τὸν προσκείμενον</quote>.   <bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

An extraordinary meeting was <quote lang="greek">σύγκλητος</quote> or <quote lang="greek">κατάκλητος</quote>.

Here, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λέσχην</lemma> is</p>
<p>not the meeting, but the discussion which is to take place there: thus the poet's phrase, true to Attic usage, corresponds with <quote lang="greek">γνώμας προθεῖναι</quote> rather than with <quote lang="greek">ἐκκλησίαν προθεῖναι</quote>.

<p> There is a general dramatic analogy between this speech and that of Oedipus in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 216" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 216</bibl>—275. In each case a Theban king addresses Theban elders, announcing a stern decree, adopted in reliance on his own wisdom, and promulgated with haughty consciousness of power; the elders receive the decree with a submissive deference under which we can perceive traces of misgiving; and as the drama proceeds, the elders become spectators of calamities occasioned by the decree, while its author turns to them for comfort.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόλεος</lemma> occurs only here in Soph. , but twice in the trimeters of  Aesch. ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

Such forms, which metrical convenience recommended to Attic poets, must not be confounded with the Ionic genitives in <quote lang="greek">ι</quote>, such as <quote lang="greek">πόλιος</quote>. The gen. <quote lang="greek">πόλευς</quote>, contracted from <quote lang="greek">πόλεος</quote>, is used by Theogn. 776 etc.— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πολλῷ σάλῳ σείσαντες</lemma>.

<p>The image of the State as a ship dates in Greek literature from Alcaeus (whom Horace copied,  <bibl default="NO" n="Hor. Carm. 1. 14" valid="yes"> <title>Carm.</title> 1. 14</bibl>), fr. 18. The ship of Alcaeus is labouring in the trough of a wild sea,—water is coming in,—the sail is torn,—the anchor will not hold: <quote lang="greek">νᾶϊ φορήμεθα σὺν μελαίνᾳ | χείμωνι μοχθεῦντες μεγάλῳ μάλα, κ.τ.λ.</quote> It is only through Heracleides <title>Alleg.

The relative clause, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἡνίκ’ . . ὤρθου πόλιν</lemma>, induced the poet to add immediately the other relative clause to which the same person is subject, viz. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐπεὶ διώλετο</lemma>, instead of inserting, after <quote lang="greek">ὤρθου πόλιν</quote>, words expressing their loyalty to Oedipus.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γένους κατ’ ἀγχιστεῖα τῶν ὀλ.</lemma>, by nearness of kinship to the dead, <quote lang="greek">γένους ἀγχιστεῖα</quote> forming one notion, on which the genit. <quote lang="greek">τῶν ὀλ</quote>. depends, as on words meaning ‘near.’ The neut. plur. <quote lang="greek">ἀγχιστεῖα</quote> (only here) would most properly mean ‘rights’ or ‘privileges’ of such nearness (cp. <quote lang="greek">ἀριστεῖα, πρωτεῖα</quote>, etc.), but seems here to be merely a poetical equiv. for the abstract <quote lang="greek">ἀγχιστεία</quote>. In Attic law <quote lang="greek">ἀγχιστεία</quote> was any degree of relationship on which a claim to an inheritance could be founded in the absence of a will otherwise disposing of it. To claim an inheritance under a will was <quote lang="greek">ἀμφισβητεῖν κατὰ διαθήκην</quote>: to claim on the ground of relationship, <quote lang="greek">ἀμφισβητεῖν κατ’ ἀγχιστείαν. συγγένεια</quote>, consanguinity, might, or might not, constitute <quote lang="greek">ἀγχιστεία</quote>: e.g.  Isaeus says of the relationship of mother to son that it is <quote lang="greek">συγγενέστατον μὲν τῇ φύσει πάντων, ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἀγχιστείαις ὁμολογουμένως οὐκ ἔστιν</quote> (or. 11 § 17), since a mother could not inherit from her son. (See <title>Selections from the Attic Orators</title>, pp. 331, 344.) Creon succeeds as the nearest male relative. Aesch. , Soph. , and  Eur. ignore the Boeotian legend which gave a son, Laodamas, to Eteocles (<bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 5.61" valid="yes">Her. 5.61</bibl>), and a son, Thersander, to Polyneices (id. 4. 147, etc.). The sisters represent the <quote lang="greek">ἐσχάτη ῥίζα</quote> (599).

<span class="line-ref">Line 186</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στείχουσαν ἀστοῖς</lemma>. Demosthenes paraphrases this by <quote lang="greek">στείχουσαν ὁμοῦ</quote> (or. 19 § 248); whence Dobree and Shilleto surmised that he read <quote lang="greek">ἆσσον</quote> (cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 312" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 312</bibl> <quote lang="greek">στείχουσαν ἡμῶν ἆσσον</quote></cit>). Now I think that I can explain why Demosthenes so paraphrased. He is applying the verses to Aeschines (see above, n. on 182): <quote lang="greek">τὴν δὲ ἄτην ὁρῶν στείχουσαν ὁμοῦ, τὴν ἐπὶ Φωκέας στρατείαν, οὐ προεῖπεν οὐδὲ προεξήγγειλεν</quote>. The <quote lang="greek">ἄτη</quote> which Aeschines saw approaching was the interference of Philip in the Sacred War,—his action against the Phocians. If Demosthenes had said <quote lang="greek">στείχουσαν ἀστοῖς</quote>, this must have seemed to refer to the fellow-citizens of Aeschines, —the Athenians. The orator therefore modified the poet's phrase by substituting <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὁμοῦ</lemma>,—a word vague enough to suggest the concern of other Greek states besides Phocis in the peril.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀντὶ τῆς σωτηρίας</lemma>, added for emphasis; ‘ruin, <emph>and not</emph> welfare, which a king is bound to promote.’ (The art. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῆς</lemma> is merely generic, as in <quote lang="greek">τὴν ἄτην</quote>.)

Though <quote lang="greek">ἐφαγνίζειν</quote> is not elsewhere extant, there seems no reason to question it. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀφαγνίσαι</lemma> has been preferred by some, merely because that compound is recognised by the old grammarians (Suid. , Hesych., Phrynichus in Bekk. <title>Anecd.</title> 26). But <quote lang="greek">ἀφαγνίζειν</quote> meant esp. to purify from guilt (<foreign lang="la">expiare</foreign>): <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 2.31.8" valid="yes">Paus. 2.31.8</bibl> (of Orestes at Troezen) <quote lang="greek">ἐκάθαιρον καὶ εἱστίων, ἐς ὃ ἀφήγνισαν</quote>, ‘until they had purged him.’ Similarly in midd., <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

The force of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀπό</lemma> is thus the same as in <quote lang="greek">ἀφοσιοῦσθαι</quote>, and in <quote lang="greek">ἀφιερώμεθα</quote> as used by <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

<span class="line-ref">Line 203</span><p> The traditional <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκκεκηρῦχθαι τάφῳ</lemma> can be explained only by supplying <quote lang="greek">λέγω</quote> or the like. But in 196 <quote lang="greek">κρύψαι</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἐφαγνίσαι</quote> depended on <quote lang="greek">κηρύξας ἔχω</quote> in 192 (I have proclaimed to the people). It would be intolerably awkward to communicate the second part of the proclamation in an oblique form with the principal verb unexpressed: —‘（<title>I tell you that</title>) it has been proclaimed.’ The choice lies between (1) Musgrave's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκκεκήρυκται τάφῳ</lemma>, and (2) Nauck's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκκεκηρῦχθαι λέγω</lemma>. In favour of (1) remark:—（<emph>a</emph>) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάφῳ</lemma> is not, indeed, necessary with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κτερίζειν</lemma>, which can be used absolutely; as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 11.455" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 11.455</bibl> <quote lang="greek">αὐτὰρ ἐπεί κε θάνω, κτεριοῦσί με δῖοι Ἀχαιοί</quote></cit>, ‘will give me funeral honours’: but, as the main point is that a <quote lang="greek">τάφος</quote> is given to one brother and refused to the other, the addition of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάφῳ</lemma> to the more general term <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κτερίζειν</lemma> is plainly desirable here. (<emph>b</emph>) The misplacement of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μήτε</lemma> is due to the thought of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κωκῦσαι</lemma> having come only after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάφῳ</lemma> had been uttered (<quote lang="greek">μήτε κτερίζειν μήτε</quote> having been preferred to <quote lang="greek">μὴ κτερίζειν μηδέ</quote>), and is not bolder than (e.g.) the misplacement of <quote lang="greek">τε</quote> in  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 1411" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 1411</bibl> f. <quote lang="greek">αὐδὴν τὴν Ἡρακλέους | ἀκοῇ τε κλύειν λεύσσειν τ’ ὄψιν</quote>. (<emph>c</emph>) The MS. error may have arisen from a reminiscence of <quote lang="greek">ἐκκεκηρῦχθαι</quote> in 27. The line of Carneades ( L. <bibl default="NO" n="D. L. 4.64" valid="yes">Diog.  4. 64</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">τοῦτον σχολῆς τῆσδ’ ἐκκεκηρῦχθαι λέγω</quote>, is no argument for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λέγω</lemma> in the text of Sophocles. What could the parodist have made of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάφῳ</lemma>? The tragic solemnity of the decree was the point of the parody, which uses <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐκκεκ</lemma>. in a different sense from the poet's (‘I proclaim that he is banished from this school’: <ref targOrder="U" target="cl27">see on 27</ref>).

After verbs of ‘taking care,’ the usu. constr. is <quote lang="greek">ὅπως</quote> with fut. indic.; but <quote lang="greek">ὡς ἄν</quote> with subj. is sometimes found, as   <bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

In elliptical phrases, where a precept or charge is given (<quote lang="greek">ὅρα</quote>, etc., being understood), the regular constr. is <quote lang="greek">ὅπως</quote> with fut. ind., as  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Lys. 1.21" valid="yes">Lys. or. 1. 21</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὅπως τοίνυν ταῦτα μηδεὶς ἀνθρώπων πεύσεται</quote></cit>.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάχους ὕπο</lemma> is the reading of the MSS. Aristotle quotes this verse as an example of a <quote lang="greek">προοίμιον</quote> used by the speaker to avert a danger from himself, and gives it thus:—<quote lang="greek">ἄναξ, ἐρῶ μὲν οὐχ ὅπως σπουδῆς ὔπο</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Rh. 3. 14" valid="yes"> <title>Rhet.</title> 3. 14</bibl>§ 10). Hence some edd. adopt <quote lang="greek">σπουδῆς</quote>, as coming from a source older than our MSS. But, since <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάχους</lemma> is free from objection, such a change is unwarrantable. Aristotle's quotations seem to have been usually made from memory, and his memory was not infallible. To take only three examples cited by Bellermann, we find: (1) <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The variant given by the schol., <foreign lang="greek">σχολῇ <emph>ταχύς</emph></foreign>, would be an oxymoron, designedly comic; ‘I took my time about hurrying,’ ‘'twas but a laggard haste that I made.’ A cheerful epigram of this sort would better suit a mind more at ease.

In Attic prose a dat. of the person after <quote lang="greek">ἔρχομαι</quote> is freq., and oft. can be rendered (as here) only by ‘<emph>to</emph>,’ though it is properly rather a dat. of interest.

As this story suggests, the very fact that the ordinary Attic word for ‘mule’ was <quote lang="greek">ἡμίονος</quote> (adj. <quote lang="greek">ὀρικός</quote>) might lead an Attic poet to prefer such a periphrasis as <quote lang="greek">ἵππειον γένος</quote>. The objections to taking <quote lang="greek">ἱππείῳ γένει</quote> as simply =<quote lang="greek">ἵπποις</quote>are,that (1) Greek ploughmen used oxen or mules more than horses, and (2) the achievement of taming the horse (350) is thus anticipated.

The midd. voice does not occur elsewhere; but this cannot be regarded as an objection, when we remember how many rare middle forms occur in the dramatists. Thus <quote lang="greek">προσορωμένα</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 244" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 244</bibl> is a solitary example of that verb in the midd., and if the license could be taken with so common a word, much more might it be allowed with a comparatively rare one. Blaydes writes <quote lang="greek">ὀχμάζει ὑπ’ ἀμφίλοφον ζυγόν</quote>: but the Ms. <quote lang="greek">ἕξεται</quote> indicates that the verb, whatever it was, was of the midd. form. <quote lang="greek">ὀχμάζεται</quote> was published by G. Schöne in 1833, and by Franz in 1846: they appear to have made the conjecture independently. Donaldson (1848) printed <quote lang="greek">ὁχμάζεται ἀμφὶ λόφον ζυγῶν</quote>, and seems to ascribe <quote lang="greek">ζυγῶν</quote> to Franz and Schöne; though Franz, at least, proposed <quote lang="greek">ἀμφὶ λόφον ζυγῷ. ζυγῶν</quote> has been revived (seemingly without knowledge of a predecessor) by H. Schütz (1886). Sophocles would write <quote lang="greek">ΑΜΦΙΛΟΦΟΝΖΥΓΟΝ</quote>, and thus <quote lang="greek">ζυγῶν</quote> changes no letter.  Aesch. used the fut. <quote lang="greek">ζυγώσω</quote> (fr. 110), and  Soph. has the verbal <quote lang="greek">ζυγωτῶν</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 702" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 702</bibl>). To <quote lang="greek">ἀμφιλόφῳ ζυγῷ</quote> it may be objected that, being clear, it was not likely to become -<quote lang="greek">ον ‐όν</quote>: but, when <quote lang="greek">ἀμφίλοφον</quote> had once been written, <quote lang="greek">ζυγῶν</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">ζυγῷ</quote>) would easily become <quote lang="greek">ζυγόν</quote>. As to the schol. on <quote lang="greek">ἀμφίλοφον,—ἀντὶ τοῦ, περιβαλὼν αὐτῷ ζυγὸν περὶ τὸν λόφον, ὑπάγει</quote>,—it cannot fairly be urged for <quote lang="greek">ζυγῶν</quote> (or for any partic.), since it may be merely a paraphrase of <quote lang="greek">ἀμφίλοφον</quote>.—Schütz's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐφέζεται</lemma> is attractive; for the acc. he cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

The guards post themselves on this rising ground, facing the corpse, and with their backs to the wind. The use of <quote lang="greek">ἐκ</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">ἀπό</quote>), with a verb denoting <emph>position</emph>, occurs only in a few places of poetry; but it is certainly genuine, and deserves attention, for its true force has not (I think) been observed.

In all these passages, a picture is presented, and we have to glance from a remoter to a nearer object. The mental eye is required to measure the space between Hera on the peak of Olympus, and Poseidon on the plain of Troy; between Megareus on the walls of Thebes, and the cavern into which his corpse is to fall. And, in each case, <quote lang="greek">ἐκ</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἀπό</quote> denotes the <emph>quarter</emph> in which the remoter object is to be looked for. This, which might be called the ‘surveying’ use, is distinct from that in which the prep. has a pregnant force, as being directly suggestive of motion (<quote lang="greek">οἱ ἐκ Σικελίας ἥξουσι</quote>); but it springs from the same mental tendency,—viz., to take a rapid glance over the dividing interval. Cp. <quote lang="greek">ἵστασθαι πρός τινος</quote> (‘on his side’). So here: in the foreground of the picture is the corpse, which they have just laid bare. Now look to the hillocks behind it; in that quarter you will see the guards at their post.—I have not cited <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

The word <quote lang="greek">σκηπτός</quote> usu.=‘a thunderbolt,’ and by its deriv. ought at least to mean a storm swooping on the earth from the sky; but the schol. attests its use in a larger sense; <quote lang="greek">σκηπτὸς δὲ λέγεται πᾶν πνεῦμα θυελλῶδες, ὅταν συνερείδῃ τῇ γῇ, καὶ πάλιν ἄνω αἴρη·| τὸ δὲ τοιοῦτο καὶ στρόβι—λόν τινες καλοῦσι, παρὰ τὸ στροβεῖν.</quote>

In these lines the poet describes the actual physical effects produced by the storm. He mentions the destruction of foliage; and we need some reference also to the main point of all—the obscuring of the air. Therefore I should not take <quote lang="greek">οὐράνιον ἄχος</quote> as=‘a <emph>heaven-sent</emph> plague’; that is presently said by <quote lang="greek">θείαν νόσον</quote> (421).

The essence of the symbolical rite was the sprinkling of dust. She had done that (245). Was it not, then, done once for all? In Horace (<title>C.</title> 1. 28. 35) the passer-by is free when the dust has been thrown; he can go his way. I have never seen this question put or answered. The only answer which I can suggest is that, at her first visit, she had not brought the <quote lang="greek">χοαί</quote>. (Cp. on 245 ff.) Perhaps the rite was considered complete only if the <quote lang="greek">χοαί</quote> were poured while the dust still covered the corpse.

(instead of the regular dat.) with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ξύνοικος</lemma>, cp. Lycurgus <title>In Leocr.</title> § 145 <quote lang="greek">οὗτος ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ χώρᾳ σύνοικος ὑμῶν γενήσεται</quote>. So <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1382" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1382</bibl> <quote lang="greek">Δίκη ξύνεδρος Ζηνός</quote></cit>. ‘The Justice that dwells with the gods below’ is their personified right to claim from the living those religious observances which devote the dead to them. A person who omits such observances is defrauding Hades of his own: see 1070. This Justice, then, ‘has not ordained such laws’ as Creon's; it has not <emph>forbidden</emph> kinsfolk to bury their dead; on the contrary, it has bound them to do so. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοιούσδ’ … ὥρισεν</lemma> is a certainly true correction of the MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οἳ τούσδ’ … ὥρισαν</lemma>. With the latter, <quote lang="greek">οἳ</quote> are either Zeus and <quote lang="greek">Δίκη</quote>,—which would be the natural sense,—or <quote lang="greek">οἱ κάτω θεοί</quote>: and <quote lang="greek">τούσδε νόμους</quote> are the laws of sepulture. But, after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάδε</lemma> in 450, referring to Creon's edicts, the demonstrative pronoun here also should refer to them. Creon has just called his own laws <quote lang="greek">τούσδε νόμους</quote> (449). If Antigone, immediately afterwards, used <quote lang="greek">τούσδε νόμους</quote> to describe the divine laws, the stress on <quote lang="greek">τούσδε</quote> would be extremely awkward. Further, <quote lang="greek">τοιούσδ’ ὥρισεν</quote> has a pathetic force which renders it incomparably finer here than the somewhat tame statement of fact, ‘who have appointed the laws of burial among men.’

<p> Kvičala and Wecklein reject these four verses, despairing of the difficulties found in vv. 466, 467, which have been variously amended; see Appendix. The alleged difficulties are, (1) <quote lang="greek">παρ’ οὐδὲν ἄλγος</quote>: (2) the mention of the mother only: (3) the position of <quote lang="greek">θανόντ’</quote>, which might suggest the sense, ‘slain by my mother’: (4) <quote lang="greek">ηἰσχόμην</quote> (as L has it). Before dealing with these points, I would call attention to a trait which the impugners of these verses have overlooked, and which speaks strongly for the genuineness of the passage as a whole, corrupt though it be in certain words. That trait is the clause <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τοῖσδε δ’ οὐκ ἀλγύνομαι</lemma> in 468, returning upon the thought <quote lang="greek">παρ’ οὐδὲν ἄλγος</quote> in 466. This series of three clauses, in which the second is opposed to the first, and the third re-iterates the sense of the first, is peculiarly Sophoclean: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 1111" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 1111</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οὐ γάρ τι τῆς σῆς οὕνεκ’ ἐστρατεύσατο | γυναικός,... | ἀλλ’ οὕνεχ’ ὅρκων οἷσιν ἦν ἐνώμοτος, | σοῦ δ’ οὐδέν</quote></cit>: similar instances are <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The only peculiarity here is that, instead of a word in the general sense, ‘<emph>is esteemed</emph>’ (<quote lang="greek">ἄγεται</quote>), we have a virtual equivalent, tinged with the special thought of the moment, viz., ‘<emph>is a pain.</emph>’ Exactly so in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The first question is, Could an Attic poet have used <quote lang="greek">ἠνσχόμην</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ἠνεσχόμην</quote>? We can only say that we find nothing really like it, and that no support for it can be drawn from the Homeric forms in which <quote lang="greek">ἀνά</quote> suffers apocope, viz., <quote lang="greek">ἄνσχεο = ἀνασχοῦ</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 23.587" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 23.587</bibl> etc.), <quote lang="greek">ἀνσχήσεσθαι</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 5.104" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 5.104</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">ἀνσχετά</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Still, there is force in Prof. Tyrrell's remark (<title>Classical Review</title>, vol. 11. p. 140) that ‘<quote lang="greek">ἠνσχόμην</quote> is just the form in which an Attic poet would have applied apocope of <quote lang="greek">ἀνά</quote>, inasmuch as he would have felt that he was only sacrificing the redundant augment.’</p>
<p>In my first edition I placed in the text the emendation of Semitelos (1887) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ᾔσχυναν κύνες</lemma>. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 22.74" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 22.74</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ὅτε δὴ πολιόν τε κάρη πολιόν τε γένειον | αἰδῶ τ’ αἰσχύνωσι κύνες κταμένοιο γέροντος</quote></cit>. If the <quote lang="greek">ες</quote> of <quote lang="greek">κύνες</quote> had been obliterated, <quote lang="greek">νέκυν</quote> would easily have arisen (esp. after <quote lang="greek">ν</quote>); and a change of <quote lang="greek">υ</quote> into <quote lang="greek">ο</quote> would have taken <quote lang="greek">ᾔσχυναν</quote> far towards <quote lang="greek">ηἰσχόμην</quote>. But, while I still hold that this brilliant conjecture has no small degree of probability, I also recognise the justice of the criticism that the context here decidedly favours a verb in the first person.</p>
<p>Other emendations will be found in the Appendix. Most of them assume that we must have <quote lang="greek">ἠνεσχόμην</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">ἀνεσχόμην</quote>), and therefore alter the words <quote lang="greek">θανόντ’ ἄθαπτον</quote> and <quote lang="greek">νέκυν</quote> in various ways, —usu. omitting <quote lang="greek">νέκυν</quote>. The verses produced by these processes are wretched, while, from a palaeographical point of view, they are pure conjectures, which do not attempt to account for the tradition in L.—Two points remain. (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν ἐξ ἐμῆς | μητρός</lemma>. This is like saying, ‘the son of the same womb.’ Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. IT 497" valid="yes">Eur. <title>I. T.</title> 497</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πότερον ἀδελφὼ μητρός ἐστον ἐκ μιᾶς</quote></cit>; Yet it has been seriously urged by many critics, as a ground for change, that a mention of the <emph>father</emph> was indispensable. <quote lang="greek">ἐμῆς</quote> need not be altered to <quote lang="greek">ὁμῆς</quote> (Seyffert)</p>
<p>or <quote lang="greek">μιᾶς</quote> (Meineke). (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὸν ἐξ ἐμ. | μητρος θανόντ’</lemma>. It is quite true that, when written, these words have an awkward ambiguity; but they would have had none when spoken, since a slight pause after <quote lang="greek">μητρός</quote> would have been required to bring out <quote lang="greek">θανόντ’</quote>. This is the right test to apply in the case of a play written to be acted.

We may add that Creon's reply in v. 508, which refers primarily to vv. 504 f., does not therefore ignore vv. 506 f., since these two vv. cohere closely with the former: vv. 504—507 express a single thought.

A corruption of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴσους</lemma> into <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τούτους</lemma> is very improbable. Rather <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴσους</lemma> was merely one of those conjectures which so often appear in the margin of the MSS., having for their object the supposed improvement of a point. The MS. <quote lang="greek">ἴσος</quote> in 520 does not strengthen the case for <quote lang="greek">ἴσους</quote> here.

The train of thought strongly favours <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴσους</lemma>, as Nauck suggests and Semitelos reads. ‘Hades may desire these rites; but the good man does not (desire) to receive only the same rites as the wicked’: i.e. Eteocles will not be satisfied with the equality merely because Polyneices was his brother (517): he will think of the contrast between that brother's merits and his own. The dead can be said <quote lang="greek">λαγχάνειν νόμους</quote> (of burial), in the sense of obtaining that which the <quote lang="greek">νόμοι</quote> give.

(cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 883" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 883</bibl> n.). The Schol. so took it (he paraphrases by <quote lang="greek">φιλαδέλφως</quote>), and it would seem, therefore, that he read <quote lang="greek">δάκρυ λειβομένη</quote>. But, though this constr. is quite admissible, it would be far more natural that <quote lang="greek">φιλάδελφα</quote> should agree with <quote lang="greek">δάκρυα</quote>. In <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1251" valid="yes"><title>O.

But <quote lang="greek">κατὰ δάκρυον εἴβειν</quote> and <quote lang="greek">δάκρυα λείβειν</quote> were equally familiar as Homeric phrases; and if an Attic poet could use the latter, there was certainly no reason why he should not use the former. I may remark, too, that <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κάτω</lemma> points to a reminiscence of the phrase</p>
<p>with <quote lang="greek">εἴβειν</quote>, for Homer never says <quote lang="greek">κατὰ δάκρυα λείβειν</quote>. Nothing is more natural than that <quote lang="greek">εἰβομένη</quote> should have become <quote lang="greek">λειβομένη</quote> in the MSS., the latter word being much the commoner.</p>

Krüger (11. § 47. 12. 2) treats <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἅ</lemma> here as a sort of adverb (<foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 11. § 46. 6. 9), i.e., <emph>in a case where</emph> you did not put your hand (to the deed, <foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">τοῦ ἔργου</quote>); but this is very awkward. Rather, I think, there is an unusual kind of attraction, due to the special form of the sentence. We could not say (e.g.) <quote lang="greek">ἃ μὴ ἐρᾷ τις, οὐ θηρᾶται</quote>, (<quote lang="greek">ἅ</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ταῦτα ὧν</quote>). But here <quote lang="greek">μηδ’ ὧν μὴ ’θιγες ποιοῦ σεαυτῆς</quote> would have been intolerable, on account of the second gen. after <quote lang="greek">ποιοῦ</quote>. For the sake of compactness, and of clearly marking the object to <quote lang="greek">ποιοῦ</quote>, the poet has here allowed <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἅ</lemma> to stand for <quote lang="greek">ταῦτα ὧν</quote>.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἥδε μὴ λέγε</lemma>, say not ‘<quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote>,’ speak not of her as still with thee, for she is already numbered with the dead. <quote lang="greek">οἵδε</quote> are <quote lang="greek">οἱ ἐνθάδε</quote>, the living (75), as <quote lang="greek">κεῖνοι</quote> (525) are <quote lang="greek">οἱ ἐκεῖ</quote>, the dead (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 76" valid="yes">cp. 76</bibl>). The peculiarity is that we should have expected either (<emph>a</emph>) <quote lang="greek">τήνδε</quote>, acc. to <quote lang="greek">λέγε</quote>, or (<emph>b</emph>) <quote lang="greek">τῆσδε</quote>, as a direct quotation from the last verse: cp.  <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 18.88" valid="yes">Dem. or. 18 § 88</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τίς ἦν...; ὑμεῖς, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι. τὸ δ’ ὑμεῖς ὅταν λέγω, λέγω τὴν πόλιν</quote></cit>. If (e.g.) <quote lang="greek">ὑμῶν</quote> had preceded <quote lang="greek">ω ἄνδρες</quote>,  Dem. would doubtless have said <quote lang="greek">τὸ δ’ ὑμῶν</quote>, or else <quote lang="greek">ὑμᾶς δ’</quote>. Here, however, no fair objection would remain if we had <quote lang="greek">ἀλλὰ τὸ ἥδε μὴ λέγε</quote>, i. e. ‘never use the word <quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote> about her,’—which makes the sense more general than if he said, <quote lang="greek">ἀλλὰ τῆσδε μὴ λέγε</quote>, i. e. ‘do not say (that you cannot live without) <quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote>.’ The question, then, seems to resolve itself into this:—Wishing to give the more general sense just indicated, could the poet say <quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote> instead of <quote lang="greek">τὸ ἥδε</quote>? To show that the art. was not always required in such quotation, it is enough to cite <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Kn. 21" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eq.</title> 21</bibl> <quote lang="greek">λέγε δὴ μόλωμεν</quote></cit>, by the side of <quote lang="greek">τὸ μόλωμεν</quote> <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Kn. 26" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 26</bibl>. While, then, I cannot produce any exact parallel for this <quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote>, I think it reasonable to suppose that colloquial idiom would have allowed it. Those who deny this have two resources. (1) To point thus: <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἥδε μέντοι—μὴ λέγ’·</quote> i.e. instead of adding <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι</quote> after <quote lang="greek">μέντοι</quote>, he breaks off his sentence—‘do not speak of her.’ So Bellermann. (2) Semitelos reads <quote lang="greek">ἀλλ’ ἥδε μέν σοι μὴ λέγ’ ὡς ἄρ’</quote> [for <quote lang="greek">οὐ γὰρ] ἔστ’ ἔτι</quote>, ‘do not say that you have <emph>her</emph> any longer.’ As to <quote lang="greek">σοι</quote>, see cr. n. above. Neither of these readings gives such a forcible sense as the vulgate.

<span class="line-ref">Line 572</span><p> It is not of much moment that L, like the later MSS., gives this verse to Ismene. Errors as to the persons occur not seldom in L (see, e.g., cr. n. to <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 837" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 837</bibl>, and cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1737" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 1737</bibl>); and here a mistake would have been peculiarly easy, as the dialogue from v. 561 onwards has been between Creon and Ismene. To me it seems certain that the verse is Antigone's, and that one of the finest touches in the play is effaced by giving it to Ismene. The taunt, <quote lang="greek">κακὰς γυναῖκας υἱέσι</quote>, moves Antigone to break the silence which she has kept since v. 560: in all this scene she has not spoken to Creon, nor does she now address him: she is thinking of Haemon,—of the dishonour to <emph>him</emph> implied in the charge of having made such a choice, —<quote lang="greek">ὡς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον</quote>. How little does his father know the heart which was in sympathy with her own. This solitary reference to her love heightens in a wonderful degree our sense of her unselfish devotion to a sacred duty. If Ismene speaks this verse, then <quote lang="greek"><emph>τὸ σὸν</emph> λέχος</quote> in 573 must be, ‘the marriage of which you talk’ (like <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 1110" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 1110</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οὐκ οἶδα τὴν σὴν κλῄδον</quote></cit>'), which certainly is not its natural sense.
</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Αἷμον</lemma>. L has <quote lang="greek">αἵμων</quote>.  Soph. would have written AIMON: hence the tradition is subject to the same ambiguity as in KPEON. The analogy of <quote lang="greek">δαῖμον</quote> would probably have recommended the form in <quote lang="greek">ο</quote>.

In the case of the Labdacidae the calamities were traced to the curse called down on Laïus by Pelops, when robbed by him of his son Chrysippus (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT" valid="yes"><title>O.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄτας οὐδὲν ἐλλείπει</lemma>, (for these men, <quote lang="greek">οἷς = τούτοις οἷς</quote>) no sort of calamity is wanting.

The phrase is bold, and somewhat strange; but I do not think that it is corrupt. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">γενεᾶς</lemma> here is the whole race, not (as in 596) a generation of the race. The words mean literally, ‘<emph>over a multitude of the race</emph>’; i.e., the <quote lang="greek">ἄτη</quote> does not cease with the person who first brought it into the family, or with his generation, but continues to afflict succeeding genera tions. The collective noun <quote lang="greek">γενεᾶς</quote> justifies the use of <quote lang="greek">πλῆθος</quote>: as he might have said, <quote lang="greek">ἀπογόνων πλῆθος</quote>. It is needless, then, to write <quote lang="greek">γενεᾶν</quote>. We cannot understand, ‘to the fulness of the race,’ i.e. till the race has been exhausted.

<span class="line-ref">Line 601</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατ’ αὖ … ἀμᾷ,</lemma> = <foreign lang="greek">καταμᾷ αὖ</foreign>, ‘mows down in its turn’ (not, ‘otherwise than we hoped’). In my first edition I adopted the conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κοπίς</lemma>. Prof. Tyrrell's able defence of the MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κόνις</lemma> (<title>Classical Review</title>, vol. 11. p. 139), though it has not removed all my difficulties, has led me to feel that more can be said for that reading than I had recognised. I now prefer, therefore, to leave <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κόνις</lemma> in the text, and to re-state here the arguments for and against it.
</p>
<p>(1) If <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κόνις</lemma> be right, <quote lang="greek">κόνις θεῶν τῶν νερτέρων</quote> is the dust, belonging (due) to the gods infernal, which Antigone strewed on her brother's corpse; it is <quote lang="greek">φοινία</quote>, because the corpse was gory. The strongest point in favour of <quote lang="greek">κόνις</quote> is that it is in harmony with the following words, <quote lang="greek">λόγου τ’ ἄνοια καὶ φρενῶν ἐρινύς</quote>. The whole sense then is: ‘She, too—the last hope of the race—is now to die,—for a handful of blood-stained dust (i.e., for a slight, yet obligatory, act of piety towards her slain brother)—and for those rash words to Creon,—the expression of her frenzied resolve.’ On the other hand, the objection to <quote lang="greek">κόνις</quote> is the verb <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καταμᾷ</lemma>, which implies the metaphor of reaping. (See Appendix.) The proposed version, ‘covers,’ is impossible, and, if possible, would be unsuitable. What we want is a verb meaning simply ‘destroys,’ or ‘dooms to death.’ Now it is true that Greek lyric poetry often tolerates some confusion of metaphor (see on v. 117, and cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. lviii): the question is whether this example of it be tolerable. Prof. Tyrrell holds that it is excused by the tumult of feeling in the mind of the Chorus. That is, the metaphor of a young life ‘mowed down’ is not completed by a mention of the <emph>agent</emph>, the Destroyer: it is swiftly succeeded in the speaker's thought by a dramatic image of the <emph>cause</emph>, Antigone sprinkling the dust, and defying Creon. This is conceivable; but it is at least extremely bold.</p>
<p>(2) If we read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κοπίς</lemma>, then <quote lang="greek">καταμᾷ</quote> is appropriate, and <quote lang="greek">φοινία</quote> also has a more evident fitness. The great objection is the want of unison with <quote lang="greek">λόγου τ’ ἄνοια καὶ φρενῶν ἐρινύς</quote>. If the <quote lang="greek">τ’</quote> after <quote lang="greek">λόγου</quote> means ‘both,’ the <quote lang="greek">κοπὶς νερτέρων</quote> is the deadly agency as seen in the girl's rash speech and resolve: if the <quote lang="greek">τ’</quote> means ‘and,’ it is an agency to which these things are superadded. On either view the language is awkward. This must be set against the gain in unity of metaphor.</p>
<p>It has further been urged against <quote lang="greek">κοπίς</quote> that the word is too homely. This may be so; but we lack proof. <quote lang="greek">κοπίς</quote> seems to have been a large curved knife, known to the Greeks chiefly as (<emph>a</emph>) a butcher's or cook's implement, (<emph>b</emph>) an oriental military weapon. It does not follow, however, that the effect here would be like that of ‘chopper,’ or of ‘scimitar,’ in English. The dignity of a word may be protected by its simplicity; and <quote lang="greek">κοπίς</quote> is merely ‘that which cuts.’ Pindar was not afraid of homeliness when he described a chorus-master as a <quote lang="greek">κρατήρ</quote>, or an inspiring thought as an <quote lang="greek">ἀκόνα</quote> (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1052" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1052</bibl> n.). Nicander could say, of the scorpion, <quote lang="greek">τοίη οἱ κέντροιο κοπίς</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Nic. Ther. 780"><title>Ther.</title> 780</bibl>). If <quote lang="greek">κοπίς</quote> be right, the change to <quote lang="greek">κόνις</quote> may have been caused, not by a misreading of letters, but by mere inadvertence,—the copyist having the word <quote lang="greek">κόνις</quote> in his thoughts at the moment: it has already occurred frequently (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 247" valid="yes">247</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 256" valid="yes">256</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 409" valid="yes">409</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 606</span><p> The MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παντογήρως</lemma> is unquestionably corrupt. Sleep, the renewer of vigour, could not be described as ‘bringing old age to all.’ Nor can the epithet be explained as ‘enfeebling all,’ in the sense of ‘subduing them’; nor, again, as ‘attending on all, even to old age.’ The neighbourhood of <quote lang="greek">ἀγήρως</quote> is not in favour of <quote lang="greek">παντογήρως</quote>, but against it; in the case of <quote lang="greek">παντοπόρος—ἄπορος</quote> (360), and of <quote lang="greek">ὑψίπολις—ἄπολις</quote> (370), there is a direct contrast between the two words. Either <quote lang="greek">πάντ’ ἀγρῶν</quote> or <quote lang="greek">πανταγρεὺς</quote> (see cr. n.) would be good, if <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’</quote> could be taken from the next verse, and added to this. But <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’</quote> clearly belongs, I think, to the next verse,—as will be seen presently. Bamberger proposed <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παντοθήρας</lemma>, or <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παντόθηρος</lemma>. The former would be a subst. like <quote lang="greek">ἰχθυοθήρας</quote>, ‘fisherman,’ <quote lang="greek">ὀρνιθοθήρας</quote>, ‘fowler’: the latter (which I should prefer), an adj. like <quote lang="greek">πολύθηρος</quote>, ‘catching much’ (Heliodorus 5. 18), <quote lang="greek">εὔθηρος</quote>, ‘having good sport.’ <quote lang="greek">παντόθηρος</quote> would suit the sense well. But its probability depends on the way in which we conceive the corrupt <quote lang="greek">παντογήρως</quote> to have arisen. It is evident that the genuine <quote lang="greek">ἀγήρως</quote> in the next line had something to do with it. It seems most likely that the eye of the transcriber who first wrote <quote lang="greek">παντογήρως</quote> had wandered to <quote lang="greek">ἀγήρως</quote>, and that by a mere inadvertence he gave a like ending to the earlier word. Now this might most easily have happened if the sixth letter of the earlier series had been <quote lang="greek">Γ</quote>, but would obviously have been less likely if that letter had been <quote lang="greek">Θ</quote>. I therefore think it more probable that <quote lang="greek">παντογήρως</quote> arose from <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πάντ’ ἀγρεύων</lemma> than from <quote lang="greek">παντόθηρος</quote>. It is immaterial that the last four letters of the latter are nearer to the MS., since, on the view just stated, the transcriber's error arose from the fact that the consecutive letters <quote lang="greek">ἀγ</quote> were common to <quote lang="greek">ἀγρεύων</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἀγήρως</quote>, and that, from these letters onwards, he accidentally copied <quote lang="greek">ἀγήρως</quote>. It may be added that such an error would have been easier with a separate word like <quote lang="greek">ἀγρεύων</quote> than with the second part of a compound like <quote lang="greek">παντόθηρος</quote>.—The verb <quote lang="greek">ἀγρεύω</quote>, ‘to catch’ (common both in verse and in prose) is used by  Soph. in fr. 507.— Soph. was thinking of <bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<span class="line-ref">Line 607</span><p> The MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔτ’ ἀκάματοι θεῶν</lemma> should answer metrically to 618 <quote lang="greek">εἰδότι δ’</quote></p>
<p><quote lang="greek">οὐδὲν ἕρπει</quote>. Far the best emendation is <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔτε θεῶν ἄκματοι</lemma> (Hermann <quote lang="greek">ἄκμητοι</quote>). This supposes merely a transposition of two words, of which L affords undoubted instances (cp. on 107), and the very natural development of <quote lang="greek">ἀκάματοι</quote> out of the rarer form <quote lang="greek">ἄκματοι</quote>. For the latter cp. <title>Hom. hymn. Apoll.</title> 520 <quote lang="greek">ἀκμήτοις δὲ λόφον προσέβαν ποσίν</quote>. The word <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεῶν</lemma> seems to me clearly genuine. Many recent editors have condemned it, because <title>Zeus</title> is the marshaller of the seasons (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 2.134" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 2.134</bibl> <quote lang="greek">Διὸς μεγάλου ἐνιαυτοί</quote></cit>, <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

Prot. 321A" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Prot.</title> 321A</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τὰς ἐκ Διὸς ὥρας</quote></cit>). How, then, could the poet say that <title>Zeus</title> is not subdued by ‘the months <emph>of the gods</emph>’<emph>?</emph> The simple answer is that the term <quote lang="greek">θεῶν</quote> is not opposed to Zeus, but includes him. Though Zeus (the Sky Father) was more especially the <quote lang="greek">ταμίας ὡρῶν</quote>, that function can also be ascribed to the gods collectively: see e.g. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Laws 886A" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Legg.</title> 886A</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οὐκοῦν, ὦ ξένε, δοκεῖ ῥᾴδιον εἷναι ἀληθεύοντας λέγειν ὡς εἰσὶ θεοί;— πῶς;—πρῶτον μὲν γῆ καὶ ἥλιος ἄστρα τε τὰ ξύμπαντα καὶ τὰ τῶν ὡρῶν διακεκοσμημένα καλῶς οὕτως, ἐνιαυτοῖς τε καὶ μησὶ διειλημμένα</quote></cit>. Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Laws 809d" valid="yes"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 809 D</bibl>, as illustrating another reason which made the phrase <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεῶν μῆνες</lemma> so natural—the fact, namely, that the <quote lang="greek">ἑορταί</quote> were the land-marks of the Calendar: <quote lang="greek">τίνων δὴ πέρι λέγομεν; ἡμερῶν τάξεως εἰς μηνῶν περιόδους καὶ μηνῶν εἰς ἕκαστον τὸν ἐνιαυτόν, ἵνα ὧραι καὶ θυσίαι καὶ ἑορταὶ τὰ προσήκοντα ἀπολαμβάνουσαι ἑαυταῖς ἕκασται... θεοῖς μὲν τὰς τιμὰς ἀποδιδῶσι κ.τ.λ.</quote> And, if <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεῶν</lemma> be genuine, then <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔτε</lemma> belongs to this verse, and we gain a fresh argument against those emendations which would append <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’</quote> to v. 606: for <quote lang="greek">οὔτ’ | ἀκάματοι θεῶν &lt;νιν</quote>&gt; is certainly not probable. See Appendix.—All the immortals have a <emph>life</emph> which is not worn out by those months which they themselves control. The distinction of Zeus is that his <emph>supremacy</emph> over gods and men is unalterable.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄκματοι</lemma>, untiring in their course: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

<span class="line-ref">Line 625</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀλίγιστον</lemma>, a superl. used not only in epic poetry but also by Attic writers (as  Ar. and Plat. ), is right here. The MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀλιγοστόν</lemma> cannot be defended by <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Peace 559" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title> 559</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πολλοστῷ χρόνῳ</quote></cit>, which is merely another form of <quote lang="greek">πολλοστῷ ἔτει</quote> (Cratinus jun. <quote lang="greek">Χείρ</quote>. 1); i.e. <quote lang="greek">πολλοστός</quote> has its proper sense, ‘one of many’ (<foreign lang="la">multesimus</foreign>), and the <quote lang="greek">χρόνος</quote>, like the <quote lang="greek">ἔτος</quote>, is conceived as the last of a series. So <quote lang="greek">ὀλιγοστὸς χρόνος</quote> would mean, not, ‘a fraction of time,’ but, ‘one in a small number of <quote lang="greek">χρόνοι</quote>’ or periods. In   <bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Met. 9.1045b.25" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Metaph.</title> 9. 1. 14</bibl> most MSS., and the best, have <quote lang="greek">ὀλίγιστον...χρόνον</quote>: while Ab (cod. Laur. 87. 12) is the only MS. cited in the Berlin ed. (p. 1053 <emph>a</emph> 9) for <quote lang="greek">ὀλιγοστόν</quote>. And otherwise <quote lang="greek">ὀλιγοστός</quote> occurs only in later Greek, as  <title>Anton.</title> 51 <quote lang="greek">καταβὰς ὀλιγοστός</quote>, ‘having gone to the coast <emph>with a small retinue</emph>’; <bibl default="NO" n="Plut. Caes. 49" valid="yes">Caes. 49</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὀλιγοστῷ τοσαύτην ἀμυνομένῳ πόλιν</quote> ‘fighting so great a State <emph>with a small force.</emph>’— <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πράσσει … ἐκτὸς ἄτας</lemma>, like <quote lang="greek">πράσσει καλῶς</quote>: so <quote lang="greek">πράσσειν κατὰ νοῦν</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

Kn. 549" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Eq.</title> 549</bibl>). <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄτας</lemma> is here ‘calamity’ (as in 584, 614), while in the last verse <quote lang="greek">ἄταν</quote> is rather ‘infatuation.’—Donaldson changed <quote lang="greek">ἄτας</quote> here to <quote lang="greek">ἄλγους</quote>, because the strophe (614) also ends with <quote lang="greek">ἐκτὸς ἄτας</quote>. On the other hand Dindorf ejects <quote lang="greek">ἐκτὸς ἄτας</quote> from 614 (leaving a lacuna). But I believe <quote lang="greek">ἐκτὸς ἄτας</quote> to be genuine in both places, as <quote lang="greek">οὐδὲν ἕρπει</quote> also is both in 613 and in 618. We have to remember, first, that  Soph. (like other ancient poets) easily tolerated repetition of words (see on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 554" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 554</bibl>); secondly, that tragic lyrics could admit refrains, and might, by a kindred instinct, permit such verbal echoes as these.

<span class="line-ref">Line 628</span><p>In the MS. reading (see cr. n.) <quote lang="greek">νύμφης</quote> is a gloss on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάλιδος</lemma>: but <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῆς μελλογάμου</lemma> should be retained. Except in the lexicons, <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις</quote> occurs only here and in a verse of Callimachus, <quote lang="greek">αὐτίκα τὴν τᾶλιν παιδὶ σὺν ἀμφιθαλεῖ</quote>, quoted by the Schol., who says, <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις λέγεται παρ’ Αἰολεῦσιν ἡ ὀνομασθεῖσά τινι νύμφη</quote>. Hesychius has, <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις· ἡ μελλόγαμος παρθένος καὶ κατωνομασμένη τινί· οἱ δὲ γυναῖκα γαμετήν· οἱ δὲ νύμφην</quote>. This shows that <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις</quote> could mean, not only an affianced bride, but also a bride after marriage: just as <quote lang="greek">νύμφη</quote> can mean either. The epithet <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῆς μελλογάμου</lemma> is not, then, superfluous; and <quote lang="greek">τῆς μελλονύμφου</quote> in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 633" valid="yes">633</bibl> is no argument against it. On the other hand <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τάλιδος</lemma>, without the epithet, would have a crude effect. A passage in Pollux (3. 45) has been taken to prove that he had <quote lang="greek">τῆς μελλογάμου</quote> in his text. It does not prove this,—nor the reverse. <quote lang="greek">τῆς μελλογάμου</quote> in Pollux should be (as Semitelos saw) <quote lang="greek">τὴν μελλόγαμον</quote>, and we should refer his words solely to <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 633" valid="yes">v. 633</bibl>. His point is simply that <quote lang="greek">ἡ μελλόνυμφος</quote> is more correct than <quote lang="greek">ἡ μελλονύμφη</quote>.—Curtius connects <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις</quote> with <quote lang="greek">τέρ‐ην</quote>, tender; <quote lang="greek">θρόνα</quote>, flowers: Sanskrit <foreign lang="sanskrit">ta/r-una-s</foreign>, youthful, tender, <foreign lang="sanskrit">ta/l-unI</foreign>, girl, young woman. He supposes the first idea to be that of a plant sprouting or blossoming (cp. <quote lang="greek">θάλος</quote>). This at least agrees well with what we know as to the usage of <quote lang="greek">τᾶλις</quote>.

<p> Seidler transposes vv. 663—667, placing them after 671. The object is to bring vv. 668—671 into immediate connection with 662. In this there is one slight grammatical gain; since, as the vv. stand in the MSS., <quote lang="greek">τοῦτον ...τὸν ἄνδρα</quote> (668) means, ‘the man who acts thus’ (viz., as described in vv. 666 f.). But the order given in the MSS. is right. The transposition obliterates one of the finest touches in the speech. Creon demands that the obedience of the citizens to the ruler shall be absolute (666 f.). And then he supplements this demand with a remark on the dignity of such obedience. The man who so obeys gives the best proof that he could also rule (668 ff.). Seidler destroys the point of vv. 668 ff. by placing them after 662.</p>
<p>The connection of thought in the whole passage—which is slightly obscured by compression—may be most clearly shown by taking the verses in small consecutive groups. (1) 659 f. If I tolerate disloyalty</p>
<p>in my own relatives, I shall encourage it in other citizens. (2) 661 f. <title>For</title> (<quote lang="greek">γάρ</quote>) only a man who is firm (<quote lang="greek">χρηστός</quote>) where his own relatives are concerned will be found to uphold justice in the State (i.e. will have the authority necessary for doing so). (3) 663 f. Now, I recognise disloyalty in any one who breaks the law and defies the government, as Antigone has done. (4) 666 f. Instead of so doing, the citizen is bound to obey the government in everything. (5) 668—671. There is nothing slavish in that; on the contrary, it shows that the citizen is not only a good subject, but would, if required, be a good ruler;—as he would also be a good soldier.—Then comes the general censure on unruliness (672—676). And then the conclusion:—I must vindicate my authority, and punish Antigone (677 —680).

Creon had urged that filial piety demands the submission of the son's judgment to the <quote lang="greek">γνώμη πατρῴα</quote> (640); and had warned Haemon against disregarding the voice of reason (648).

Now, I know what the Thebans are saying of your action; and, as a son devoted to your welfare, I ought to tell you.’—The tact and deference which mark this speech place Creon's <quote lang="greek">αὐθάδεια</quote> in a stronger light.</p>

Herwerden has suggested something like <quote lang="greek">κοὐδείς ποτ’ ἀστῶν ἐμφανῶς χρῆται, πάτερ, | λόγοις τοιούτοις κ.τ.λ.</quote> Nauck thinks that either v. 691 is wholly spurious, or that the words <quote lang="greek">λόγοις τοιούτοις</quote> are corrupt. But, while the dat. is certainly bold—esp. with <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρὶ δ.</quote> preceding it—it is (I think) quite within the possibilities of classical idiom. We should remember that Athenians were accustomed to use a simple dat. (of ‘time’ or ‘occasion’) in speaking of festivals,—as <quote lang="greek">τραγῳδοῖς καινοῖς</quote>: cp. (e.g.) <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

Cp. also <bibl default="NO" n="Thuc. 1.84" valid="yes">Thuc. I. 84</bibl> <quote lang="greek">εὐπραγίαις...οὐκ ἐξυβρίζομεν</quote>, where the notion, ‘by reason of successes,’ is similarly blended with the notion, ‘in seasons of success.’</p>

Either word is admissible; but I slightly prefer <quote lang="greek">διπλᾶ</quote>, for this reason. It is true that the plur. of <quote lang="greek">διπλοῦς</quote> in poetry usu.=simply ‘two’ (51, 1232, 1320, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 20" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 20</bibl>, 1135). But  Soph. has at least one instance of the distributive sense (‘two sets’), viz., <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1249" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1249</bibl>, where <quote lang="greek">διπλοῦς</quote>=a twofold brood, i.e. Oed., and his children. (I do not add <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 288" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 288</bibl> <quote lang="greek">διπλοῦς | πομπούς</quote></cit>, taking it to mean merely ‘two,’ not ‘two sets.’) And in Attic prose the distributive use is not rare: thus in <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Laws 722E" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Legg.</title> 722E</bibl> <quote lang="greek">διπλοῖ... νόμοι</quote></cit> are not ‘two laws,’ but ‘two sets of laws.’ We have, then, good warrant for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διπλᾶ</lemma> here as=‘two sets of arguments.’</p>
<p>On the other hand, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διπλῇ</lemma> is strange (though possible) as=‘in two ways,’ i.e. ‘on both sides.’ It usu. means, ‘doubly’ (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 760" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 760</bibl> <quote lang="greek">κεἰ θανεῖν μέλλω διπλῇ</quote></cit>); or ‘twice as much’ (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

<p> Objections have been made to the traditional order of these verses, chiefly in two respects. (1) 755 <quote lang="greek">εἰ μὴ πατὴρ ἦσθ’</quote> is—it is argued—the strongest thing said by Haemon, and ought therefore to come immediately before Creon's final outburst, <quote lang="greek">ἄληθες</quote>; (758). How could it be followed by merely so mild a phrase as <quote lang="greek">μὴ κώτιλλέ με</quote>?—We may reply:— Haemon says that, <emph>if</emph> Creon were not his father, he <emph>would have</emph> thought him mad. It is to this that <quote lang="greek">μὴ κώτιλλέ με</quote> refers, meaning, ‘Do not seek to deceive me by an affectation of filial deference.’ (2) 757 <quote lang="greek">βούλει λέγειν τι</quote> is too mild a remark—it is said—to form the climax of provocation to Creon's anger. We may reply:—It is in substance, if not in form, such a climax, —for a father who holds that <emph>unquestioning</emph> obedience (640) is a son's first duty. It asserts Haemon's right to maintain his own views against his father's,—<quote lang="greek">διὰ δίκης ἰέναι</quote>, as Creon put it (742). The traditional order seems, therefore, to be right.</p>
<p>Three modes of transposition have been proposed. (1) Enger puts 756 and 757 after 749. Then <quote lang="greek">κώτιλλε</quote> (756) refers to Haemon's plea that he has his father's cause, and that of religion, at heart. We lose nothing by such a transposition; but neither do we gain.</p>
<p>(2) Donner (in his transl., ed. 1863) simply transposed verses 755 and 757, leaving the rest as they stand. For this it may fairly be said that 757 comes very fitly after 754. On the other hand it seems to me that 756 does not aptly follow 757.</p>
<p>(3) Pallis arranges thus:—749, 756, 755, 754, 757, 750—753. Thus <quote lang="greek">κενὰς γνώμας</quote> (753) becomes the last sting.— The fact is that, in a stormy altercation, we do not look for a closely logical texture and a delicately graduated <foreign lang="it">crescendo.</foreign> The MS. order is (to my mind) the best; but other arrangements are possible, and would be nearly as good.
</p>
<p> Creon, instead of replying to v. 749, abruptly repeats his resolve. <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς ταύτην ἔτι ζῶσαν γαμεῖς</quote> (fut.) <quote lang="greek">ποτέ</quote>, it cannot be that you shall ever wed her while she yet lives; i.e. she is to die at once, and can become your bride, if ever, only <quote lang="greek">ἐν Ἅιδου</quote> (654). <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Soph. often admits bold arrangements of words (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1245" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1245</bibl>, 1251: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1428" valid="yes"><title>O.

Verse 773 shows that Creon is not yet thinking of any particular spot. And <quote lang="greek">κατῶρυξ</quote> shows that he is not thinking of some merely natural grotto or cavern. This word, usu. an adj., here a subst., means a cavern, or chamber, excavated by man's hand: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

So the place is described by <quote lang="greek">κατασκαφής</quote> (891). The <quote lang="greek">κατῶρυξ</quote> actually used was near the furthest and highest part of the plain, where Polyneices lay (1197). What, then, was the poet's conception? He seems to suppose the existence of tombs artificially constructed in the rocky <quote lang="greek">πάγοι</quote> (411) which bordered on the Theban plain. In one of these tombs— chosen for the remoteness of its situation (773)—Antigone is to be immured. The general type of sepulchral chamber supposed here can be illustrated from actual remains which have been discovered in Greece: see below on vv. 1216 ff.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄγος</lemma> was used by  Soph. in his lost <title>Phaedra</title> to denote <quote lang="greek">ἅγνισμα θυσίας</quote> (Hesych. 1. 63), i.e. ‘an expiatory sacrifice’ (cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Eum. 325" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title> 325</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἅγνισμα φόνου</quote></cit>). In <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 154" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Cho.</title> 154</bibl> also <quote lang="greek">ἄγος</quote> has been taken as=‘expiation,’ but there it seems rather to be ‘pollution.’ Cp. the schol. here: <quote lang="greek">ἔθος παλαιόν, ὥστε τὸν βουλόμενον καθειργνύναι τινὰ ἀφοσιοῦσθαι βραχὺ τιθέντα τροφῆς, καὶ ὑπενόουν κάθαρσιν τὸ τοιοῦτο, ἵνα μὴ δοκῶσι λιμῷ ἀναιρεῖν· τοῦτο γὰρ ἀσεβές</quote>.—Curtius, <title>Etym.</title> 5th ed., § 118, would write <quote lang="greek">ἅγος</quote> here. He distinguishes two roots. (1) <quote lang="greek">ἀγ‐, ἄγος</quote>, ‘guilt,’ <quote lang="greek">ἐναγής</quote>, ‘accursed’; Sanskr. <foreign lang="sanskrit">Aa/g-as</foreign>, ‘vexation,’ etc. (2) <quote lang="greek">ἁγ‐, ἅγος</quote>, ‘consecration, sacrifice,’ <quote lang="greek">ἅγιος</quote>, etc.: Sanskr. <foreign lang="sanskrit">jag-.</foreign> On the other hand the analogy of <foreign lang="la">piaculum</foreign> suggests that <quote lang="greek">ἄγος</quote> might combine the sense of ‘expiation’ with that of ‘pollution.’</p>
<p>Creon's edict had announced that the transgressor would be publicly stoned to death (36). It is to this that the anxious question of the Chorus alludes (772). Creon had already said that Antigone's doom was to be <quote lang="greek">κάκιστος</quote> (489). But now, at least, he feels that he cannot inflict such a death on the maiden, his kinswoman. She shall die, not by stoning, but by starvation. The choice is not prompted by cruelty, but simply by the desire to avoid physical violence.</p>
<p>The danger of a <quote lang="greek">μίασμα</quote>—to be avoided by a dole of food—has no relation to the special circumstances,—Antigone's royal birth, and the nature of her offence. In the ancient belief, that danger existed whenever a person was put to death by starvation. Two notions were probably blended; (<emph>a</emph>) that, if a little food was given, the death was nature's work, not man's; (<emph>b</emph>) that the <quote lang="greek">νέρτεροι</quote> claimed an indemnity for the usual <quote lang="greek">ἐναγίσματα</quote>. So the Greeks put Philoctetes ashore on desolate Lemnos, —<quote lang="greek">ῥάκη προθέντες βαιὰ καί τι καὶ βορᾶς | ἐπωφέλημα σμικρόν</quote> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 274" valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 274</bibl>). So, too, when a Vestal was to be buried alive, the small vault in the Campus Sceleratus was furnished with a couch, a burning lamp, and a small table, on which the dole was placed,—bread, olives, milk, and a jug of water (  <bibl default="NO" n="Plut.

In two respects it differs from the ancient accounts of the Niobe (quoted below): (<emph>a</emph>) it does not ‘weep,’—for the rainwater drops from the front of the niche, clear of the figure; and (<emph>b</emph>) the likeness to a human form grows, instead of vanishing, as one approaches. (<title>Journ. Hellen. Studies</title> III. 61 ff., 1882.) This has been confirmed by another traveller, Herr Schweisthal (as reported in the <title>Berl. Phil. Wochenschr.</title>, May 28, 1887, p. 704). He finds the true Niobe at no great distance from the Cybele, but nearer Magnesia, and in the vicinity of a stream (the Jarikkaia) which Humann, in his ‘Excursion into Sipylus’ (1881), had already identified with the Achelous of <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Il. 24.616" valid="yes"><title>Il.</title> 24.616</bibl>. It is a natural phenomenon,—the semblance—as seen from a distance—of a draped woman, seated high on the rocks; she looks towards the right, and lifts her right arm, as if in lament.</p>
<p>The best ancient description is by a poet whose native place was in that neighbourhood,—Quintus Smyrnaeus (1. 293— 306):—‘Her streaming tears still fall from the heights of the rugged cliff; and in sympathy with her the sounding waters of the Hermus make lament, and the lofty peaks of Sipylus, over which the mist that shepherds dread floats evermore. A great marvel is she to passers by, because she is like a sorrowful woman, who mourns some cruel grief, and weeps without stint. Such verily seems the figure, when thou gazest at it from afar; but when thou drawest near, lo, 'tis but a sheer rock, a cliff of Sipylus’ (<quote lang="greek">φαίνεται αἰπήεσσα πέτρη, Σιπύλοιό τ’ ἀπορρώξ</quote>).</p>
<p>Nonnus was thinking of the effect <emph>from the road</emph>, when he wrote (2. 160), <quote lang="greek">ἕσσομαι ὡς Νιόβη καὶ ἐγὼ λίθος, ὄφρα καὶ αὐτὴν | λαϊνέην στενάχουσαν ἐποικτείρωσιν ὁδῖται</quote>. Pausanias, too, says that, at a certain distance from the cliff, <quote lang="greek">δεδακρυμένην δόξεις ὁρᾶν καὶ κατηφῆ γυναῖκα</quote>, but that the illusion vanishes on a nearer approach (1. 21 § 3).

<span class="line-ref">Line 851</span><p> Though every treatment of this verse must remain subject to doubt, far the most probable (to my mind) is Seyffert's modification of Boeckh's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βροτοῖς οὔτ’ ἐν νεκροῖς κυροῦσα</lemma>. This gives an exact correspondence with 870, <quote lang="greek">κασίγνητε γάμων κυρήσας</quote>, and there is every reason to think that 870 is sound. Further, the origin of L's reading is elucidated. The first <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οὔτε</lemma> is omitted (<cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

<p>to taking <quote lang="greek">οἶκτον</quote> as acc. in apposition with <quote lang="greek">ἔψαυσας...μερίμνας</quote> is that this would imply <quote lang="greek">τό</quote> (<quote lang="greek">σε</quote>) <quote lang="greek">ψαῦσαι ἀλγ. ἐμοὶ μερίμνης οἶκτός ἐστιν</quote>: as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

Now, if we had, for instance, <quote lang="greek">ἀνεμνήσθην μερίμνης</quote>, it is conceivable that <quote lang="greek">οἶκτον</quote>, as acc. in appos., should mean <quote lang="greek">οἴκτου ἀφορμήν</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἔγερσιν</quote>. But when, as here, the subject of <quote lang="greek">ἔψαυσας</quote> is distinct from the person who makes the lament, it seems impossible that <quote lang="greek">οἶκτον</quote> should have this pregnant sense.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀλγ. μερίμνας</lemma> is certainly not acc. plur. <ref targOrder="U" target="cl546">See on 546</ref> and 961. No Greek hearer of these lyrics could take <quote lang="greek">μερίμνας</quote> for anything but the usual gen. after <quote lang="greek">ψαύω</quote>. If  Soph. had intended the acc., he would at least have written <quote lang="greek">ἀλγεινοτάταν...μέριμναν</quote>.—The interpretation given above would admit the reading <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">οἶτον</lemma>, ‘doom,’ which has, however, less authority (cr. n.). <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

But, as <quote lang="greek">οἶτον πότμου</quote> is an impossible pleonasm, it would then be necessary to take <quote lang="greek">τοῦ τε ...πότμου</quote> as depending on <quote lang="greek">ἔψαυσας</quote>: for <quote lang="greek">τριπόλιστον οἶτον</quote> could not be a parenthetic acc. in apposition with <quote lang="greek">ἔψαυσας... μερίμνας πατρός</quote>. This would be very awkward. Further, <quote lang="greek">οἶκτον</quote> is clearly the right word to introduce the lament <quote lang="greek">ἰώ</quote>, etc., which actually follows.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τριπόλιστον</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">οἶκτον</quote>), a lament which has often been renewed; a thrice-told tale of sorrow. <quote lang="greek">πολέω</quote>=to turn up the soil with the plough: <quote lang="greek">ἀναπολέω</quote>, to plough anew: then fig., to ‘go over the same ground’ again.   <bibl default="NO" n="Pind.

She speaks first of those kinsfolk to whom she had rendered pious offices in the usual manner.

The <quote lang="greek">χοαί</quote> could be rendered afterwards. She loved both brothers (cp. on 523).

    <p> Few problems of Greek Tragedy have been more discussed than the question whether these vv., or some of them, are spurious.  Arist. ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristot. Rh. 3.16" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> 3. 16</bibl>§ 9) quotes <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 24.912" valid="yes">vv. 911, 912</bibl>, and certainly had the whole passage in his text of  The Soph. interpolation, then, if such it be, must have been made soon after the poet's death; and has been imputed to his son  Iophon (<quote lang="greek">ὁ ψυχρός</quote>), or some other sorry poet; or to the actors. I confess that, after long thought, I cannot bring myself to believe that  Soph. wrote 905—912: with which 904 and 913—920 are in organic unity, and must now stand or fall. Some remarks will be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The main points (to my mind) are briefly these. (1) The general validity of the divine law, as asserted in 450— 460, cannot be intelligibly reconciled with the limitation in vv. 905—907. (2) A still further limitation is involved in 911 f. She has buried her brother, not simply as such, but because, while he lived, he was an irreplaceable relative. Could she have hoped for the birth of another brother, she would not, then, have felt the duty to be so binding. (3) The composition of vv. 909—912 is unworthy of Sophocles.

Antigone had believed hat the city was on her side (509). This has been noted as a mark of spuriousness in the verse. But it cannot (I think) be fairly claimed as such; for, since the Chorus had seemed to fail in sympathy (838), she had regarded herself as <quote lang="greek">ἄφιλος</quote> (876) in Thebes.

Rh. 3.16" valid="yes">Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> 3.16</bibl> § 9 (if you introduce a trait of character which will seem improbable, the reason ofit should be added): <quote lang="greek">ἂν δ’ ἄπιστον ᾖ, τότε τὴν αἰτίαν ἐπιλέγειν, ὥσπερ Σοφοκλῆς ποιεῖ παράδειγμα τὸ ἐκ τῆς Ἀντιγόνης, ὅτι μᾶλλον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἐκήδετο ἢ ἀνδρὸς ἢ τέκνων· τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἂν γενέσθαι ἀπολόμενα</quote> [this=vv. 909, 910]: <quote lang="greek">μητρὸς δ’ ἐν ᾅδου κ.τ.λ.</quote> (he then quotes 911 f., with <quote lang="greek">βεβηκότων</quote>,—a mere slip of memory: <ref targOrder="U" target="cl223">see on 223</ref>).</p>
<p>Three points in these vv. are strange. (1) The gen. abs. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κατθανόντος</lemma>, for which a gen. has to be evolved from <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόσις</lemma>. The gen. of that word was not in Attic use (‘mihi non succurrit exemplum ubi <quote lang="greek">πόσεος</quote> aut <quote lang="greek">πόσεως</quote> legatur,’ Pors.  <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Med. 906" valid="yes"> <title>Med.</title> 906</bibl>). Why was not <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρός</quote> used?   Itlooks as if the composer who made up these verses from <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 3.119" valid="yes">Her. 3.119</bibl> (see above) had sought to impart a touch of tragic dignity by substituting <quote lang="greek">πόσις</quote> for the historian's word, <quote lang="greek">ἀνήρ</quote>. The gen. <quote lang="greek">κατθανόντος</quote> cannot be taken (as some wish) with <quote lang="greek">ἄλλος</quote>, ‘different from the dead’ (!). (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀπ’ ἄλλου φωτός</lemma>. Why is it assumed that the first husband died before, or with, his child? The two hypotheses of loss should have been kept separate. We wanted something like <quote lang="greek">καὶ παῖς ἂν ἄλλος, παιδὸς ἐστερημένῃ</quote>. (3) <emph><quote lang="greek">τοῦδ’</quote></emph> means the first husband's child, but is most awkward.—As to <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστ’ ἀδελφός κ.τ.λ.</quote>, it may be somewhat inelegant; but it is not (as some urge) incorrect, since <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔστιν ὅστις = οὐδείς</quote>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 944</span><p> Acrisius, the father of Danaë, was king of Argos. The oracle at Delphi told him that he was to be slain by his daughter's son. He therefore immured the maiden in a chamber built for that purpose within the precincts of his house at Argos. Here Zeus visited her in the golden rain; she bore Perseus; and Acrisius sent mother and child adrift on the Aegean in a chest; but Zeus heard her prayer, and brought them safely to the island of Seriphus. Both  Soph. and  Eur. wrote a <quote lang="greek">Δανάη</quote>:  Soph. wrote also an <quote lang="greek">Ἀκρίσιος</quote>.</p>

(2. 23. 7) says that he saw at Argos <quote lang="greek">κατάγεων οἰκοδόμημα, ἐπ’ αὐτῷ δὲ ἦν ὁ χαλκοῦς θάλαμος</quote> (made by Acrisius): i.e. the <quote lang="greek">θάλαμος</quote> itself was above ground;—as Horace calls it <quote lang="la">turris aenea</quote> (<title>C.</title> 3. 16. 1). By the epithet <quote lang="greek">χαλκοῦς</quote> the legend evidently meant to denote the strength and security of the prison,—as though the doors were of bronze. But it is very probable that this epithet originally came into the story through a reminiscence of a tomb (like the ‘treasury of Atreus’ at Mycenae), to the walls of which bronze plates had been nailed. (Cp. <title>Introd. to Homer</title>, ch. 11. § 25.) In Simonides fr. 37. 7 <quote lang="greek">χαλκεογόμφῳ</quote> is said of the chest in which Danaë was sent adrift,—not of the <quote lang="greek">θάλαμος</quote>.

<span class="line-ref">Line 965</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Μούσας</lemma>. An interesting illustration is afforded by a sarcophagus in Baumeister's <title>Denkmaeler</title>, p.837. In the centre of the group is the raging Lycurgus, with uplifted axe, about to slay the Dionysiac nymph Ambrosia, who cowers at his feet. A Fury is on each side of him, urging him on. To the right is Dionysus.—about to</p>
<p>save the nymph by changing her into a vine; and behind him stand his followers. At the extreme left are three Muses—Urania, with globe; Clio, with roll; Euterpè, prob. with flutes. (Zoega seems clearly right in thus explaining the three women: others have made them Moirae.)—The close relation of Dionysus with the Muses is marked by one of his Attic titles, <quote lang="greek">Μελπόμενος</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 1.2.5" valid="yes">Paus. 1.2.5</bibl>), as conversely Apollo had the title <quote lang="greek">Διονυσόδοτος</quote> (id. 1. 31.4). Muses were sometimes said to have nursed him. (Cp. Welcker, <title>Götterl.</title> 2. 611.)</p>
<p>The monuments relating to the myth of Lycurgus have been critically treated by Michaelis (<title>Annal. Inst.</title> 1872, pp. 248— 270). The Italian vase-paintings follow a version different from that of Soph. , viz. that the frenzy of Lycurgus was wreaked on his own son and wife. A large Neapolitan vase gives two pictures: in one, we see his murderous rage; in the other, Dionysus sits on his throne in calm majesty, stroking his panther.

<span class="line-ref">Line 966</span><p> Cleopatra is the third example. Her father was the wind-god, Boreas: her mother, the Athenian Oreithyia, whom he carried off to his wild home in Thrace. Cleopatra married Phineus, king of the Thracian Salmydessus, on the W. coast of the Euxine, not far from the entrance to the Bosporus. She bore him two sons. He afterwards put her away, and imprisoned her. Her imprisonment is not directly mentioned here: but cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Diod. 4. 44" valid="yes">Diod.  4. 44</bibl>, who says of Heracles, when serving with the Argonauts, <quote lang="greek">τὴν Κλεοπάτραν ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς προαγαγεῖν</quote>. Phineus then married Eidothea, sister of Cadmus. Eidothea put out the eyes of Cleopatra's two sons, and caused them also to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>It is the fate of Cleopatra herself which  Soph. means to compare with Antigone's: this is plain from 986. The fate of the sons is made so prominent only because nothing else could give us so strong a sense of the savage hatred which pursued the mother.</p>
<p> Soph. supposes the outline of the story to be familiar. Cleopatra has already been divorced and imprisoned. The poet chooses the moment at which Cleopatra's sons are being blinded by Eidothea, with the sharp shuttle in her blood-stained hands. Ares, the god of cruel bloodshed, beholds with joy a deed so worthy of his Thracian realm.</p>
<p>The name of Cleopatra (like that of Capaneus, 133) is not mentioned. Two strophes are given to this theme, partly, perh., as having an Attic interest (982).  Soph. wrote two plays called <quote lang="greek">Φινεύς</quote>. We know only that Cleopatra's sons were there called <quote lang="greek">Ὄαρθος</quote> (?<quote lang="greek">Παρθένιος</quote> H. Weil) and <quote lang="greek">Κράμβος</quote>: and that the subsequent blindness of Phineus was represented as a punishment of his cruelty (schol. Apoll. Rhod. 2. 178). Eidothea was mentioned by  Soph. in his <quote lang="greek">Τυμπανισταί</quote> (schol. on 980),—a play which perh. concerned the Dionysiac worship, since the <quote lang="greek">τύμπανον</quote> (kettle-drum) was used in his <quote lang="greek">ὄργια</quote> as well as in those of Cybelè. Another version called her Idaea, daughter of Dardanus.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παρὰ δὲ Κυανεᾶν πελάγει δ. ἁλός</lemma>. For the double possessive gen., cp.795,929. <quote lang="greek">πελάγει...ἁλός</quote>, as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Tro. 88" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Tro.</title> 88</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πέλαγος Αἰγαίας ἁλός</quote></cit>, the Homeric <quote lang="greek">ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσιν</quote>, etc. The rocky islets on the N. side of the entrance from the Euxine to the Bosporus were regularly called <quote lang="greek">Κυάνεαι</quote> simply (without <quote lang="greek">νῆσοι</quote> or <quote lang="greek">πέτραι</quote>, <bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 4.85" valid="yes">Her. 4.85</bibl>). L's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πετρῶν</lemma> has long been recognised as a gloss. But Wieseler's change</p>
<p>of <quote lang="greek">πελαγέων</quote> into <quote lang="greek">σπιλάδων</quote> is also erroneous.</p>
<p>L's accent, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πελάγεων</lemma>, points to the truth,—as similar small hints in that MS. have been found to do elsewhere also (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1113" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1113</bibl> n.). The correction, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πελάγει</lemma>, is so easy that it may well have occurred to others; but I have not met with it. It removes the difficulty (insuperable, to my mind) of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">παρά</lemma> with the genitive here. Those who read <quote lang="greek">κυανεᾶν σπιλάδων</quote>, or <quote lang="greek">κυανέων πελαγέων</quote>, are forced to take <quote lang="greek">παρά</quote> as=‘<emph>extending from</emph> the dark rocks (etc.) are the coasts.’ But such a use is wholly unparalleled. As to 1123, see n. there. In   <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 1" valid="yes">Pind. <title>P.</title> 1. 75</bibl><quote lang="greek">ἀρέομαι | πὰρ μὲν Σαλαμῖνος Ἀθαναίων χάριν</quote>=‘<emph>from</emph> Salamis’ (i.e., by celebrating it). In <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Ach. 68" valid="yes">Aristoph. <title>Ach.</title> 68</bibl> the Ravenna has <quote lang="greek">ἐτρυχόμεσθα παρὰ Καΰστρίων | πεδίων ὁδοιπλανοῦντες</quote>, while other MSS. have <quote lang="greek">διὰ</quote> (also with gen. plur.); but there <quote lang="greek">παρὰ Καΰστριον | πεδίον</quote> (Dindorf) is certain. In   <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 3" valid="yes">Pind. <title>P.</title> 3. 60</bibl><quote lang="greek">γνόντα τὸ πὰρ ποδός</quote>, ‘having learned one's nearest business’ (cp.  <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 10" valid="yes">Pind. <title>P.</title> 10. 63</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">παρά</quote> has its normal sense,—‘that which begins <emph>from</emph> one's foot,’=which is directly before one in one's path. The corruption of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πελάγει</lemma> into <quote lang="greek">πελαγέων</quote> naturally followed that of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Κυανεᾶν</lemma> into <quote lang="greek">κυανέων</quote>.

The city Salmydessus stood just  S. of the promontory of Thynias, about 60 miles N.W. of the entrance of the Bosporus, near the modern Midjeh. The name Salmydessus was given also to the tract of coast extending  S. of the town.—After <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Θρῃκῶν</lemma> a cretic has been lost (=-<quote lang="greek">τον γονάν</quote> in 980). Boeckh supplies it with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄξενος</lemma>, which is at least simple and fitting. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

But the want of a verb is somewhat awkward. Can the missing word be <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κλῄζεται</lemma>? (Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1451" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1451</bibl> n.: and for the sing., below, 1133.) Ships often grounded on the shallows (<quote lang="greek">τέναγος</quote>) which stretched from Salmydessus into the Euxine. The Thracians had set up slabs (<quote lang="greek">στῆλαι</quote>), marking off the coast into allotments for wrecking purposes. Before this was done, there had been much bloodshed between rival wreckers (<bibl default="NO" n="Xen. Anab. 7.5.13" valid="yes">Xen. <title>Anab.</title> 7.5.13</bibl>).—The MS. †<emph><quote lang="greek">ἠδ’</quote></emph> cannot be right. A short syll. is required (=the last syll. of <quote lang="greek">ἔχοντες</quote> in 980). In my first ed. I adopted <emph><quote lang="greek">ἰδ’</quote></emph>, the conjecture of Triclinius. Prof. Tyrrell remarks (<title>Class. Review</title> vol. 11. p. 141) that <quote lang="greek">ἰδέ</quote> is not elsewhere elided in classical poetry. As <quote lang="greek">ἠδέ</quote> could be elided, that may be accidental. Still, it should be noted along with the other facts,—that <quote lang="greek">ἰδέ</quote> occurs nowhere else in tragedy, and that the hiatus after <quote lang="greek">Βοσπόριαι</quote> must be excused, as in epic verse, by the ictus before caesura (<title>Introd. to Homer</title> p. 194): cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

On the whole, I now prefer to leave <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἠδ’</lemma>, with an obelus. Either <quote lang="greek">Βοσπόριαι καὶ ὁ</quote> or <quote lang="greek">Βοσπόριαί θ’ ὅ τε</quote> would be possible.

<span class="line-ref">Line 970</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγχίπολις Ἄρης</lemma>. This reading (L's) agrees metrically with the antistrophe (981 <quote lang="greek">ἀρχαιογόνων</quote>), if we suppose the 2nd and 3rd syllables of <quote lang="greek">ἀγχίπολις</quote> to represent a resolved long syllable. Such a resolution is rare, but not unexampled: <ref targOrder="U" target="cl797">see on 797 f.</ref>. We could avoid it by reading, with Gleditsch, <quote lang="greek">ἀκταὶ Βοσπόριαι, <emph>ἵν’</emph> ὁ Θρῃκῶν ἄξενος | Σαλμυδησσὸς <emph>Ἄρης τ’</emph> a)gxi/polis</quote>. But (<emph>a</emph>) this does not explain how <quote lang="greek">ἠδ’</quote> came into the MSS.: and (<emph>b</emph>) it is evidently better to say, ‘where Ares saw,’ than, ‘where Salmydessus and Ares saw.’ The reference to the god's cruel joy would thus lose much of its force. If, on the other hand, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀγχίπτολις</lemma> is read, then <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἄρης</lemma> has <quote lang="greek">α—</quote>, and in 981 we must suppose the loss of a syllable after <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀρχαιογόνων</lemma>. But such a loss is very improbable: that verse appears sound. Neither <quote lang="greek">ἄγχουρος</quote> nor <quote lang="greek">ἀρχέπολις</quote> has any likelihood.—Ares is ‘neighbour to the city’ of Salmydessus because his home is in Thrace (<bibl default="NO" n="Hom.

It is of this that  Soph. is thinking here: cp. fr. 575 <quote lang="greek">ἡμεῖς δ’ ἐν ἄντροις, ἔνθα Σαρπηδὼν πέτρα</quote>. That verse is from the <quote lang="greek">Τυμπανισταί</quote>, in which the story of Cleopatra was noticed (cp. on 966); and she was probably the speaker.

Still, for poetry, it seems possible. (2) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαντικῆς</lemma>. Such a gen., joined to a verbal adj. with <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">α</lemma> privative, more often denotes the agent, answering to a gen. with <quote lang="greek">ὑπό</quote> after a pass. verb, or to the subject of an act. verb: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 847" valid="yes">cp. 847</bibl>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 685" valid="yes"><title>Tr.</title> 685</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἀκτῖνος...ἄθικτον</quote></cit> (untouched <emph>by</emph> the ray). Here, the instrument, <quote lang="greek">μαντική</quote>, is, in fact, personified as the agent: i.e., <quote lang="greek">μαντικῆς</quote> does not correspond to the instrum. dat. in <quote lang="greek">καὶ μαντικῇ πράσσετε περὶ ἐμοῦ</quote>, but to the nom. in <quote lang="greek">καὶ μαντικὴ πράσσει περὶ ἐμοῦ ὑμῖν</quote> (ye have even seer-craft practising on me). An easier reading would be <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαντικῇ</lemma>. The instrumental dat. is often retained with the negative verbal; as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Sym. 219E" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Symp.</title> 219E</bibl> <quote lang="greek">χρήμασι...μᾶλλον ἄτρωτος ἢ σιδήρῳ</quote></cit>: fr. com. anon. 52 <quote lang="greek">ἀνεπιβουλεύτου φθόνῳ</quote>. But poetical usage seems to warrant <quote lang="greek">μαντικῆς</quote>.—The conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄπρατος</lemma> (see Appendix) would forestall the taunt which now forms the climax, <quote lang="greek">ἐξημπόλημαι</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶν δ’ ὑπαὶ γένους</lemma>, ‘by the tribe of those men.’—the <quote lang="greek">μάντεις</quote> implied in <quote lang="greek">μαντικῆς</quote>. Creon, though he addresses Teiresias, is speaking as much to the Chorus as to him. If we read <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τῶν</lemma> (without <emph><quote lang="greek">δ’</quote></emph>), as relative, it would naturally</p>
<p>refer to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑμῖν</lemma>: it could hardly refer to <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαντικῆς</lemma>. The conjecture of Semitelos, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μαντικοῖς</lemma>, would then be attractive. But such a substitute for <quote lang="greek">μάντεσι</quote> would be very strange. And, if we keep L's <emph><quote lang="greek">τῶν δ’</quote></emph>, the scornful demonstrative sufficiently interprets the reference to <quote lang="greek">μάντεις.</quote>

<span class="line-ref">Line 1044</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">θεοὺς μιαίνειν</lemma>. Teiresias had said that the altars were defiled (1016). Creon replies that he will not yield, even if birds fly with the carrion up to the very throne of Zeus;—‘<emph>for no mortal can pollute the gods.</emph>’ Campbell takes this to be an utterance of scepticism, like <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔφα τις | θεοὺς βροτῶν ἀξιοῦσθαι μέλειν</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 369" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title> 369</bibl>),—anticipating the Epicurean conception of gods who are neither pleased nor angered by men.</p>
<p>This view seems to do some injustice to the poet's dramatic psychology. I read the words quite differently. The most orthodox Greek piety held that ‘no mortal could pollute the gods.’ See, for example,  <title>H. F.</title> 1232. Heracles, having recovered sanity after slaying his children, has covered his face, to hide it from the holy light of the sun. Theseus —who is a type of normal <quote lang="greek">εὐσέβεια</quote>— makes him uncover, saying,—<quote lang="greek">τί δ’; οὐ μιαίνεις θνητὸς ὢν τὰ τῶν θεῶν</quote>. The sungod cannot be polluted by a mortal. The idea of religious <quote lang="greek">μίασμα</quote> was that a mortal had contracted some impurity which disqualified him for communion with the gods. The tainting of an altar cut off such communion by bringing uncleanness to the very place where men sought to be cleansed. Creon excitedly imagines a seemingly worse profanation, and then excuses his apparent impiety by a general maxim which all would admit:—‘no man can pollute the gods.’</p>
<p>‘The sky-throne of Zeus is still more sacred than his altar on earth: if defilement cannot reach him there, much less here.’ The sophism is of the kind with which an honest but stubborn and wrongheaded man might seek to quiet his conscience. Creon reveres Zeus (304): he feels for the majesty of the gods, and refuses to believe that they can honour the wicked (284 ff.). But his religious sense is temporarily confused by his anger.

The message which he has to utter is fraught with no <quote lang="greek">κέρδη</quote>—for Creon. For the plur. <quote lang="greek">κέρδη</quote> in this general sense, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Ant. 726" valid="yes">cp. 726</bibl>. Creon's reply (1063) refers to the covert threat: ‘say what thou wilt, thou shalt not shake my purpose.’— The choice lies between this view and that of the Scholiast, who makes the verse interrogative:—<quote lang="greek">οὕτω νομίζεις, ὅτι ἐπὶ κέρδεσι λέγω</quote>; i.e., ‘what, do I seem <emph>now</emph>— on thy part—to be speaking for money?’ The points in favour of the Scholiast's interpretation are:—（<emph>a</emph>) The combination <quote lang="greek">γάρ...καί</quote> (before the verb) suits an indignant question: <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 770" valid="yes">cp. 770</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Trach. 1124" valid="yes"><title>Tr.</title> 1124</bibl>. (<emph>b</emph>) The tone of rising anger—which began at 1060—fitly preludes the outburst at 1064: cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 343" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 343</bibl>—350. But on the other hand:—（<emph>a</emph>) The indignation comes late, seeing that Creon has already used the same taunt four times (1036, 1047, 1055, 1059); not, indeed, in so directly personal a form, yet still openly enough. (<emph>b</emph>) Though the seer is angered (1085), it is dramatically better to conceive him as speaking here with a stern calmness. (<emph>c</emph>) It would be correct to say (e.g.) <quote lang="greek">πέφασμαι λέγων, τὸ σὸν μέρος</quote> (‘I have been represented as speaking..., so far as you could create such a belief’): but hardly, <quote lang="greek">δοκῶ τὸ σὸν μέρος</quote>, as merely=<quote lang="greek">δοκῶ σοί</quote>.— On the whole, then, the first view is best. —Others, which may be rejected, are:— (1) ‘I think that I <emph>shall</emph> speak for your <emph>good.</emph>’ But, if we are thus to supply <quote lang="greek">ἐπὶ κέρδεσιν</quote>, and not <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἐπὶ κέρδεσιν</quote>, the verse must be interrogative. (2) ‘So far as you are concerned, I do not expect to speak for my own profit’; i.e., I shall receive no thanks from you. (3) ‘Do you really think that I shall find any satisfaction in speaking?’—i.e., it will be only pain for you, without advantage for me.

(<lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κάτισθι</lemma> then has the constr. with inf., as 473 <quote lang="greek">ἴσθι ...πίπτειν</quote>). It may be right. But <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τελῶν</lemma>, if not a usual phrase, is a natural one; and it is more impressive here to say, ‘<emph>thou shalt not live through</emph> many days,’ than, ‘the sun shall not fulfil many days.’</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τρόχους</lemma> = <foreign lang="greek">δρόμους</foreign>, ‘courses.’ The MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τροχους</lemma>=‘runners,’ i.e., <quote lang="greek">κύκλους</quote>, wheels. The authority for this Attic distinction goes back at least to the Augustan age: see Chandler § 332 n. 1 (2nd ed.), who cites Ammonius p. 137 <quote lang="greek">τροχοὶ ὀξυτόνως καὶ τρόχοι βαρυτόνως διαφέρουσι παρὰ τοῖς Ἀττικοῖς. φησὶ Τρύφων</quote> (in the Augustan age) <quote lang="greek">ἐν δευτέρᾳ περὶ Ἀττικῆς προσῳδίας. τοὺς μὲν γὰρ περιφερεῖς τροχοὺς ὁμοίως ἡμῖν προφέρονται ὀξυτονοῦντες· τρόχους δὲ βαρυτόνως λέγουσι τοὺς δρόμους</quote>. This passage helps to explain why our MSS. all give <quote lang="greek">τροχούς</quote> here. When Ammonius wrote (towards the end of the 4th cent. A.D. ) <quote lang="greek">τρόχος</quote>, ‘course,’ was known only as an Atticism, while <quote lang="greek">τροχός</quote>, ‘wheel,’ was a common word.</p>

But the parallelism of <quote lang="greek">ἔχεις μέν...ἔχεις δέ</quote> plainly requires that <quote lang="greek">ἀνθ’ ὧν</quote> should apply in the same sense to both clauses.

<p> The <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πόλεις</lemma> are the cities which had furnished contingents to the Argive expedition against Thebes. These cities are stirred with passionate hatred against Creon by the tidings that burial has been refused to their fallen warriors. There is no <emph>direct</emph> allusion to the war of the Epigoni,—the expedition which the sons of the fallen chiefs led against Thebes, and in which they destroyed it. Bergk's <quote lang="greek">συνταράξονται</quote> might suggest such an allusion; but the pres. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">συνταράσσονται</lemma> is right. The reference is to the feelings which <emph>now</emph> agitate the cities. Those feelings are one day to produce the new war. Here the prophet notes them only as signs of a still distant storm. Having foretold a domestic sorrow for the father, he now foreshadows a public danger for the king.</p>
<p>It has been objected that the play contains no hint of burial having been denied to any one except Polyneices. This is not exactly the case: the phrase <quote lang="greek">τῶν ἐχθρῶν κακά</quote> in v. 10 is such a hint. But it was unnecessary for the poet to state a fact which all his hearers would assume. Every one knew how Creon had refused burial to the Argives, and how Theseus had recovered their corpses by force of arms. In the <title>Supplices</title> of  Eur. the Chorus consists of widows and mothers of the unburied warriors. No Athenian exploit was more famous (<bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 9.27" valid="yes">Her. 9.27</bibl>; <bibl default="NO" n="Isoc. 4.52" valid="yes">Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> § 52</bibl>, <title>Encom. Helen.</title> § 31, <title>Panath.</title> § 168;   <bibl default="NO" n="Plat. Menex. 244" valid="yes">Plat. <title>Menex.</title> 244</bibl>; <bibl default="NO" n="Lys. 2.4" valid="yes">[Lys. ] or. 2 §§ 4 ff.</bibl>: <bibl default="NO" n="Dem. 60.7" valid="yes">[Dem. ] or. 60 §§ 7 ff.</bibl>). The war of the Epigoni, which was included in the epic <title>Thebais</title> ( <bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 9. 9" valid="yes">Paus.  9. 9</bibl>§ 5), was dramatised both by  Aesch. and by  Soph. (<quote lang="greek">Ἐπίγονοι</quote>).</p>
<p>Just as, in the <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title></bibl> (1410 n.),  Soph. glances at the theme of his <title>Antigone</title>, so here he might naturally glance—however indirectly—at a later chapter of the Theban story,—whether his <title>Epigoni</title> already existed, or was still in the future. Dramatically, the reference is the more fitting, since the legend represented Teiresias as still living, and still zealous for Theban welfare, when the Epigoni came.—For other views of the passage, see Appendix.

The <foreign lang="la">v.l.</foreign> <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καθήγισαν</lemma> reaches the same meaning (‘buried’) by a different channel. <quote lang="greek">καθαγίζω</quote> was properly ‘to devote’ or ‘dedicate’: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 1.86" valid="yes">Her. 1.86</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἀκροθίνια ...καταγιεῖν θεῶν ὅτεῳ δή</quote></cit>.

But (apart from L's support) <quote lang="greek">καθήγνισαν</quote> seems preferable on two grounds: (<emph>a</emph>) its primary sense lends force to the grim irony: (<emph>b</emph>) the funereal sense of <quote lang="greek">καθαγίζω</quote> has only post-classical evidence.—Hesychius (<quote lang="greek">καθαγίσω</quote>) says that  Soph. used <quote lang="greek">καθαγίζω</quote>, not in the sense of <quote lang="greek">καθιερόω</quote>, but in that of <quote lang="greek">μιαίνω</quote>:—a statement perh. founded on a misunderstanding</p>
<p>of <quote lang="greek">καθήγισαν</quote> here. The Schol. read the latter (<quote lang="greek">μετὰ ἄγους ἐκόμισαν</quote>). But the fact that L has <quote lang="greek">καθήγνισαν</quote> must be set against these doubtful testimonies.—For the irony, cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἡσυχωτέραν</lemma>, the MS. reading, has been prudently retained by most of the recent edd. In   <bibl default="NO" n="Plat.

It is true that our MSS. have no great weight on such a point, and that, if the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ω</lemma> form had been the current one in later Greek, it would have been likely to oust an older form in <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αι</lemma>. But we see that sometimes, at least, the MSS. could preserve the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αι</lemma> and the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ω</lemma> forms side by side. It seems safer, then, to suppose that the normal <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ω</lemma> form and the irregular <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αι</lemma> form were both in Attic use, than to assume that the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αι</lemma> form alone was tolerated. The dictum of Thomas Magister, (quoted by Dindorf,) p. 426 <quote lang="greek">ἡσυχαίτερον· οὐχ ἡσυχώτερον</quote>, is indecisive without more evidence than we possess.

The words could mean either: (1) ‘since this hair which clothes my head, once dark, has been white’: or (2) ‘since this hair,—once dark, now white,—has clothed my head,’ i.e., from infancy. The first is the sense intended here. There is a certain looseness of expression, since the thought is, ‘though I am old, I can recall no such case’; whereas the period actually described might be a comparatively short one.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1098</span><p> The question between L's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λαβεῖν</lemma>, and the <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Κρέον</lemma> of later MSS., is not an easy one to decide. If <quote lang="greek">λαβεῖν</quote> is an error, then it must be explained by the scribe's eye having wandered to v. 1094. But it has not been noticed (I think) that the argument from v. 1094 is two-edged. There, the scribe of L wrote <quote lang="greek">λαβεῖν</quote>, which was afterwards corrected to <quote lang="greek">λακεῖν</quote>, either by his own hand or by another. It might be held, then, that he wrote <quote lang="greek">λαβεῖν</quote>, by an error of the eye, in 1094, because his archetype had <quote lang="greek">λαβεῖν</quote> in 1098. The epexegetic construction of the inf. (= <quote lang="greek">ὥστε λαβεῖν αὐτήν</quote>, see examples on 489 f.) may have been a stumblingblock, leading transcribers to think it a redundant gloss; when <quote lang="greek">Κρέον</quote> would have been the obvious resource. Everything considered, I prefer to retain <quote lang="greek">λαβεῖν</quote>.

The region meant is the furthest and highest part of the Theban plain (1197), where the body of Polyneices still lay. In the <quote lang="greek">πάγοι</quote> adjacent to it was the rocky tomb of Antigone (774 n.).—Hermann assumed the loss of some vv. after 1110, in which Creon described the <quote lang="greek">ἐπόψιος τόπος</quote>,—explaining that he would first bury Polyneices, and then free Antigone. But what need was there for this, when he was himself to accompany his servants? Besides, his men, like all the other Thebans, might be supposed to know the place meant; and the Chorus had already said what was to be done there. Equally baseless is Bergk's theory that vv. 1111 —1114 are an interpolation, designed to fill a gap in the original text. See the notes on them. Dindorf agrees with Bergk only so far as to suspect vv. 1111, 1112.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1119</span><p> The traditional reading, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἰταλίαν</lemma>, may be supported by these considerations. (1) Southern Italy, the seat of so many Greek colonies, was preeminently associated with the cultivation of the vine; and Sophocles has himself used the name which expresses that fact: <title>Triptolemus</title> fr. 538 <quote lang="greek">Οἰνωτρία τε πᾶσα καὶ Τυρσηνικὸς | κόλπος Αιγυστική τε γῆ σε δέξεται</quote>. (2) The opening words of the ode, <quote lang="greek">Καδμείας νύμφας ἄγαλμα</quote>, claim Thebes as the birth-place of Dionysus. Though Italy, then, is mentioned before Eleusis, Parnassus and Euboea, that precedence has not the effect of representing Italy as the head-quarters of the Dionysiac worship. Rather the mention of Italy just after Thebes serves to exalt the Theban god by marking the wide range of his power. And this reference to a distant country well suits the immediately following <quote lang="greek">παγκοίνοις</quote>, expressing that Eleusis receives votaries from every part of the Greek world. (3) Athenian colonists founded Thurii, on the site of Sybaris, in 444—3 B.C.,—only two or three years before the probable date of this play. Thus, just at this time, the Athenian mind had been turned towards Southern Italy, and the allusion would strike a chord of sympathy in the audience. It may be worth remembering that the poet himself would naturally have felt a more than common interest in the new home of his friend Herodotus.</p>
<p>The only worthy rival of <quote lang="greek">Ἰταλίαν</quote> is the conjecture <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἰκαρίαν</lemma>. This was the name of a deme in the N.  E. of Attica, picturesquely situated in an upland valley bounded on the N. by the mountainchain (‘Aphorismo’) which shuts in the plain of Marathon, and on the s. by Pentelicus. The site—at a place called ‘Dionyso’—is proved by local inscriptions, found by members of the American School in 1888. The story was that, when Dionysus first entered Attica, he was received at Icaria by Icarius, whom he taught to make wine. Icaria was associated with the earliest celebrations of the rural Dionysia (thus the <quote lang="greek">ἀσκωλιασμός</quote>, or dancing on greased wine-skins, was said to have been introduced by Icarius himself), and with the infancy of Attic drama in both kinds,—as it was also the birth-place of Thespis , and, at a later time, of the comic poet Magnes. Inscriptions and other remains show that, in the 5th century B.C., it was the seat of an active Dionysiac worship, with dramatic performances. These discoveries remind us that Sophocles might well have called Icaria <quote lang="greek">κλυτάν</quote>. Prof.  C. Merriam A. further points out that, in literature, the legend of Icaria is often associated with that of Eleusis (<title>American School at Athens: Seventh Annual Report</title>, 1887—88, p. 96). To Statius,  <bibl default="NO" n="Stat. Theb. 12.619"> <title>Theb.</title> 12. 619</bibl>（<title>Icarii Celeique domus</title>), may be added  <bibl default="NO" n="Apollod. 3.14.7" valid="yes">Apollod.  3. 14. 7</bibl>, Lucian <title>De Salt.</title> 39 f., Nonnus 27. 283 ff., etc. But these facts remain: (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">Ἰταλίαν</lemma> is also suitable, and is in all the MSS.: (2) it widens the range ascribed to the god's power: (3) a corruption of <quote lang="greek">Ἰκαρίαν</quote> into <quote lang="greek">Ἰταλίαν</quote> is not one to which the letters would readily lend themselves, and would have been the less likely to occur because Icaria was familiarly associated with Dionysus.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1126</span><p> The general sense is: ‘and on the heights of Parnassus thou holdest thy revels by night amid the Corycian Nymphs, who brandish torches.’</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">διλόφου πέτρας</lemma>: i.e., two <quote lang="greek">πέτραι</quote>, each with a <quote lang="greek">λόφος</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 146" valid="yes">cp. 146</bibl> <quote lang="greek">δικρατεῖς λόγχας</quote>, n.): two peaks, one of which stands on each side of a great recess in the steep cliffs above Delphi,—the cliffs called <quote lang="greek">Φαιδριάδες</quote>, ‘gleaming,’ from their splendour in the morning sunshine (cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 86" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 86</bibl> ff.). These cliffs are about 2000 ft. above sealevel. The easternmost of the two peaks was called <quote lang="greek">Ὑάμπεια</quote>: the westernmost, perh. <quote lang="greek">Ναυπλία</quote>, but this is doubtful. Neither of them is the summit of Parnassus. That summit, called <quote lang="greek">Αυκώρεια</quote>, rises high above them (about 8000 ft. above the sea). Misunderstanding <quote lang="greek">δικόρυφος</quote>, the Roman poets gave a wrong impression by their ‘biceps Parnassus,’ which Lucan brings out when he says (<bibl default="NO" n="Luc. 5.72" valid="yes">5. 72</bibl>) ‘Parnassus gemino petit aethera colle.’</p>
<p>By <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὑπὲρ διλόφου πέτρας</lemma>  Soph. means the high ground above these two lower péaks, but below the summit of Parnassus. This high ground is what  Eur. calls the <quote lang="greek">δικόρυφος πλάξ</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ba. 307" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Bacch.</title> 307</bibl>). It consists of uplands stretching about 16 miles westward from the summit, and affording pasturage, interspersed with firs, and with pieces of arable land: wheat, oats, and barley are now grown there. These uplands were the scene of a Dionysiac <quote lang="greek">τριετηρίς</quote>, a torch-festival, held every second year, at the end of winter, by women from the surrounding districts; even Attic women went to it (<bibl default="NO" n="Paus. 10.4.3" valid="yes">Paus. 10.4.3</bibl>). Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Luc. 5.73" valid="yes">Lucan 5. 73</bibl> <quote lang="la">Mons Phoebo Bromioque sacer, cui numine misto | Delphica Thebanae referunt trieteria Bacchae:</quote> and <bibl default="NO" n="Macr. 1.18.3">Macrobius <title>Sat.</title> 1. 18. 3</bibl>. Here, however, the poet alludes, not to the human festival, but to supernatural revels.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">λιγνύς</lemma> is a smoky flame, such as a resinous pine-torch gives; <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στέροψ</lemma> finely expresses the lurid and fitful glare flashing through the smoke.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὄπωπε</lemma>, gnomic perf., ‘hath (oft) seen thee’: i.e., when the Nymphs brandish their torches, Dionysus is in the midst of them. It was the popular belief that dancing fires could be seen by night on Parnassus, when the god was holding his revels. <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 716" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 716</bibl> (Parnassus) <quote lang="greek">ἵνα Βάκχιος ἀμφιπύρους ἀνέχων πεύκας | λαιψηρὰ πηδᾷ νυκτιπόλοις ἅμα σὺν Βάκχαις</quote>: cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

The Parnassian cave is near the top of a hill on the high table-land which lies at the base of the central cone,— about 7 miles N. E. of Delphi, and as many N.W. of Aráchova.  E. Itis a large stalactite cavern, consisting of an outer chamber of some 200 ft. in length, and an inner one of about 100 ft.; the greatest breadth is about 200 ft., and the greatest height, <bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

An old place of sacrifice can still be seen in it; and an inscription found there shows that it was sacred <quote lang="greek">Πανὶ καὶ νύμφαις</quote> (<title>C. I.

<p>The simple transposition, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">στείχουσι νύμφαι</lemma> for <quote lang="greek">νύμφαι στείχουσι</quote>, satisfies the metre, and is far more probable than the change of <quote lang="greek">στείχουσι</quote> into <quote lang="greek">στίχουσι</quote>,—a form which, though noticed by Hesychius, is not known to have been used by any Attic writer of the classical age.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1146</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πνειόντων</lemma>, Brunck's simple correction of <quote lang="greek">πνεόντων</quote>, heals the metre. The MS. reading in 1137 f. is above all reasonable suspicion; and these verses now agree with them. It is a sin against all critical method to make violent changes in 1137 f.—as Dindorf (followed by Wecklein) does—in order to keep the short syllable of <quote lang="greek">πνεόντων</quote> here. Hermann's argument against <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πνειόντων</lemma>, which has deterred editors from admitting it, was strangely weal. He said that the first syllable of the epic <quote lang="greek">πνείω</quote> never occurs with ictus (i.e., in arsis); and that, if the tragic poets had used that form, they would at least not have put an ictus on the <quote lang="greek">πνει</quote>. But Homer repeatedly has <quote lang="greek">πνοιῇ</quote> with ictus on the 1st syll. (as first word of the verse): and as <quote lang="greek">πνοιή</quote> to <quote lang="greek">πνοή</quote>, so is <quote lang="greek">πνείω</quote> to <quote lang="greek">πνέω</quote>. It is plain, therefore, that the Homeric absence of ictus from the <quote lang="greek">πνει</quote> of <quote lang="greek">πνείω</quote> was purely an accident of convenience in composition, —the phrases being <quote lang="greek">μένεα πνείοντες, ζεφυρίη πνείουσα, ἡδὺ μάλα πνείουσαν, πνείει τε καὶ ἕρπει</quote>, etc. We need not dwell, then, on the fact which makes a second fallacy in the argument,—viz. that the ictus on <quote lang="greek">πνει</quote> here is only equal to that which falls on <quote lang="greek">οντ</quote> (see   Anal.). Tragic lyrics teem with epic forms and phrases. <quote lang="greek">ζάω</quote> was at least as familiar a word as <quote lang="greek">πνέω</quote>. Yet twice in lyrics  Soph. has ventured to use the epic <quote lang="greek">ζώω</quote>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 157" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 157</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οἵα Χρυσόθεμις ζώει</quote></cit>: <title>O.C.</title> 1213 <quote lang="greek">ζώειν</quote>. Is it, then, reasonable to suppose that the poet, requiring ¯¯¯ instead of ˘¯¯, would have hesitated to use the familiar epic form <quote lang="greek">πνειόντων</quote>? Nor is this all. In <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Lib. 621" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Cho.</title> 621</bibl> the MSS. give <quote lang="greek">πνέονθ’ ἁ κυνόφρων ὕπνῳ</quote>: where <quote lang="greek">πνέονθ’ ἁ = σύμμετρον</quote> in the strophe (610), and the 1st syllable is (pace Hermanni) necessarily long, being that of a spondee (or trochee): Heath's correction, <quote lang="greek">πνείονθ’</quote>, is therefore certain.</p>
<p>Other conjectures are: (1) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἰὼ πύρπνων ἄστρων χοραγὲ καὶ νυχίων</lemma> (G. Wolff). The objection is that the contracted <quote lang="greek">πύρπνους</quote> and <quote lang="greek">πύρπνουν</quote> do not justify <quote lang="greek">πύρπνων</quote> for <quote lang="greek">πυρπνόων</quote>: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Med. 478" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Med.</title> 478</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ταύρων πυρπνόων ἐπιστάτην</quote></cit>. (2) <quote lang="greek">ὢ</quote> (for <quote lang="greek">ἰὼ</quote>) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πῦρ πνεόντων χοραγὲ καὶ νυχίων</lemma> (Campbell). Here <quote lang="greek">πνεόντων</quote> is a spondee. But such a synizesis seems very improbable. Remark, too, that L's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χοραγὲ ἄστρων</lemma> does not warrant us in supposing that <quote lang="greek">ἄστρων</quote></p>
<p>originally preceded <quote lang="greek">χοραγέ</quote>. Neglect of elision is frequent in L: thus, to take one play only, the <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title></bibl> supplies these examples: 266 <quote lang="greek">τἀμά· ἐπεὶ</quote>: 694 <quote lang="greek">ἔστιν δὲ οἶον</quote>: 883 <quote lang="greek">τάδε. ὕβρις</quote>: 915 <quote lang="greek">κύρια ὦδε</quote>: 1026 <quote lang="greek">θηρῶντα ἡ τύχη</quote>: 1210 <quote lang="greek">ἴσθι, ἐάνπερ</quote>. The deletion of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καί</lemma> before <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">νυχίων</lemma> is also varranted by instances in which <quote lang="greek">καί</quote> has been thrust into L. Here, the <quote lang="greek">καί</quote> would decidedly enfeeble the passage.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">χοράγ’ ἄστρων</lemma>. The sympathetic joy of the elemental powers—stars, moon, and sea—was especially associated with those night-festivals in which Dionysus bore his mystic character, as the young <quote lang="greek">Ἴακχος</quote> of the Eleusinian ritual, the companion of Demeter and Cora (n. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 682" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 682</bibl> ff.). See <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Ion 1078" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 1078</bibl> ff., where the reference is to the Dionysus of the Great Mysteries at Eleusis: <quote lang="greek">ὅτε καὶ Διὸς ἀστερωπὸς | ἀνεχόρευσεν αἰθήρ, | χορεύει δὲ Σελάνα | καὶ πεντήκοντα κόραι | Νηρέος</quote>. Hence this crowning strain, which begins by greeting him as <quote lang="greek">χοραγὸς ἄστρων</quote>, fitly closes with his Eleusinian name.</p>

<span class="line-ref">Line 1166</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">προδῶσιν</lemma>. <foreign lang="greek">προδιδόναι ἡδονάς</foreign> could not mean merely, ‘to <emph>resign</emph>’ one's joys. It necessarily implies a fault on the loser's part; and it is precisely because Creon had committed such a fault that I believe <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">προδῶσιν</lemma> to be sound. The man accused of taking a bribe to break the law was described at 322 as <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἀργύρῳ... τὴν ψυχὴν προδούς</quote>. Our word, ‘to forfeit,’ i.e. ‘to lose by one's own fault,’ seems fairly to represent the shade of meaning which distinguishes <quote lang="greek">προδιδόναι ἡδονάς</quote> from <quote lang="greek">ἀπολλύναι ἡδονάς</quote>. Creon's joys—the life of his son, and the good opinion of his subjects—have been sacrificed by him to the indulgence of stubborn self-will. Athenaeus, who twice quotes this passage (cr. n.), shows that c. 200 A. D. it was read as above: he is our oldest and best source for it. L's <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀνδρὸς</lemma> must be considered in connection with the fact that L (like our other MSS.) omits v. 1167. L has a point at <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">προδῶσιν</lemma>, and its reading was (I suspect) understood thus: ‘when (men) forfeit their pleasures, I do not count that the part of a man’ (i.e. of one who can be really said to live). Hence I do not think that L's <quote lang="greek">ἀνδρὸς</quote> really confirms Seyffert's conjecture, <quote lang="greek"><emph>καὶ γὰρ ἡδοναὶ</emph> | ὅταν προδῶσιν ἀνδρός</quote>, ‘when a man's pleasures <emph>fail.</emph>’ For this use of <quote lang="greek">προδιδόναι</quote>, cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 7.187" valid="yes">Her. 7.187</bibl> <quote lang="greek">οὐδέν μοι θωῦμα παρίσταται προδοῦναι τὰ ῥέεθρα τῶν ποταμῶν</quote></cit> (that they failed=<quote lang="greek">ἐπιλιπεῖν</quote>): <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 8.52" valid="yes">id. 8. 52</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τοῦ φράγματος προδεδωκότος</quote></cit>, the barricade having failed (them).

Yet here the phrase would seem a strange one. And if <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἄνδρες</lemma> was older than <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἀνδρός</lemma>, as we have reason to believe that it was, that fact would confirm the genuineness of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τὰς γὰρ ἡδονάς</lemma>.—See Appendix.</p>

They are to go along this passage to the very mouth (<quote lang="greek">στόμιον</quote>) of the sepulchral chamber into which it opens.</p>
<p>The kind of tomb which the poet here imagines is perhaps best represented, in Greece, by the rock-tombs of Nauplia, and of Spata in Attica. These consist of chambers worked horizontally into the rock, and approached by a passage or <quote lang="greek">δρόμος</quote>, answering to that which Creon's men have to traverse before they reach the <quote lang="greek">στόμιον</quote> of the tomb. The general type seems to have been determined by that of the more elaborate domed tombs, such as the so-called ‘Treasury of Atreus’ at Mycenae, which, like these ruder copies, were entered by a <quote lang="greek">δρόμος</quote>. Indeed, the Nauplia tombs indicate a rough attempt to reproduce the dome (<quote lang="greek">θόλος</quote>). [See Helbig, <title>Das Homer. Epos aus den Denkm. erläutert</title>, p. 53, with the sources quoted there in nn. 5, 6.]</p>
<p>The phrase <quote lang="greek">λοίσθιον τύμβευμα</quote> (1220) might suggest a recess <emph>within</emph> the principal chamber, like that in the ‘Treasury of Atreus’; but it is simpler to take it as merely ‘the furthest part of the tomb.’ We may observe that the words <quote lang="greek">κατῶρυξ</quote> (774) and <quote lang="greek">κατασκαφής</quote> (891) are sufficiently explained if we suppose that the <quote lang="greek">δρόμος</quote> leading to the chamber sloped downwards from the entrance.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1219</span><p> The simple correction, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κελευσμάτων</lemma> for <quote lang="greek">κελεύσμασιν</quote>, is (I think) certainly right. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Pers. 397" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title> 397</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἔπαισαν ἅλμην βρύχιον ἐκ κελεύσματος</quote></cit> (and similarly <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. IT 1405" valid="yes">Eur. <title>I. T.</title> 1405</bibl>): <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Hdt. 6.50" valid="yes">Her. 6.50</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἔλεγε δὲ ταῦτα ἐξ ἐπιστολῆς τῆς Δημαρήτου</quote></cit>.</p>
<p>With <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κελεύσμασιν</lemma>, we have only two tolerable resources. (1) To join <quote lang="greek">κελεύσμασιν ἐξ ἀθύμου δεσπότου</quote>, ‘orders given by him.’ But, though <quote lang="greek">τοῖς ἐξ ἀθ. δεσπ. κελεύσμασιν</quote> could be defended by <quote lang="greek">τὴν ἐξ ἐμοῦ δυσβουλίαν</quote> (95), the phrase without the article is very strange. In phrases which might appear similar, it will be found that a verb has influenced the use of <quote lang="greek">ἐκ</quote> with gen.: thus <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 137" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 137</bibl> <quote lang="greek">σὲ δ’ ὅταν... | λόγος ἐκ Δαναῶν κακόθρους ἐπιβῇ</quote></cit>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Ag. 1366" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title> 1366</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἦ γὰρ τεκμηρίοισιν ἐξ οἰμωγμάτων | μαντευσόμεσθα τἀνδρὸς ὡς ὀλωλότος</quote></cit>; here, however, it is impossible to take <quote lang="greek">ἐξ ἀθύμου δεσπότου</quote> with <quote lang="greek">ἠθροῦμεν</quote>, and to make <quote lang="greek">κελεύσμασιν</quote> a mere epexegesis (‘looked, at our master's instigation, i.e., by his command’).</p>
<p>(2) The alternative is to amend <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐξ ἀθύμου</lemma>. Only one correction is probable, viz. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὀξυθύμου</lemma>. The decisive objection to this is the sense. It could mean only, ‘swift to wrath,’ like <quote lang="greek">ὀξύχολος</quote> (955). It could not mean merely, ‘agitated’ (by alarm). But Creon is no longer proud or fierce; he has been humbled: his late words (1211 ff.) expressed only grief and fear.</p>
<p>Dindorf writes <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κελεύμασιν</lemma>, holding this to be the older Attic form (cr. n.). The fact appears to be that both <quote lang="greek">κέλευμα</quote> and <quote lang="greek">κέλευσμα</quote> are well attested in our MSS. of some authors: and there is no evidence from inscriptions. As regards the verb, Lobeck (on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 704" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 704</bibl>) remarks that, while <quote lang="greek">ἐκελεύσθην</quote> is far commoner than <quote lang="greek">ἐκελεύθην, κεκέλευμαι</quote> and <quote lang="greek">κεκέλευσμαι</quote> are both well attested for the best age. But Veitch's statement on this point is more accurate. While <quote lang="greek">ἐκελεύθην</quote> is extremely rare in classical Greek, <quote lang="greek">κεκέλευμαι</quote> is nearly (if not quite) unknown to it. It would be very rash, then, to affirm that  Soph. must have used the nonsigmatic form of the noun.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1232</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πτύσας προσώπῳ</lemma>. Haemon is momentarily insane with despair and rage: the very words <quote lang="greek">αὑτῷ χολωθείς</quote>, 1235, indicate the transport of frenzy which these verses were meant to depict. Nothing could do more violence to the language, or more injury to the dramatic effect, than the Scholiast's theory that <quote lang="greek">πτύσας προσώπῳ</quote> has a merely figurative sense, ‘with an expression of loathing on his face.’ When the figurative sense of a word (like <quote lang="greek">πτύσας</quote>) is to be marked by a qualifying addition (like <quote lang="greek">προσώπῳ</quote>), that addition must not be such as equally to suggest the literal sense. Thus a socialist riot might be called ‘a fire not of Hephaestus’ (<bibl default="NO" n="Eur.

<p>Haemon, in his madness, meant to kill his father. He had harboured no such purpose before (<ref targOrder="U" target="cl752">see on 752</ref>); and his frantic impulse is instantly followed by violent remorse.  Arist.

It need not be assumed that  Arist. meant to censure Sophocles; it is more natural to suppose that he cited the exception as one justified by the circumstances. But it should further be noticed that Aristotle was not accurate in taking this incident as the exception which illustrated his rule. For Haemon did not abandon his dreadful purpose; he was simply foiled by his father's flight. And then, in swift remorse, he actually did <quote lang="greek">τῶν ἀνηκέστων τι</quote>.

The soundness of the metre is confirmed by the antistrophic verse (1296), which is free from suspicion. Construe: <quote lang="greek">ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ κάρᾳ ἔπαισέ με, μέγα βάρος ἔχων</quote>. Three points claim notice. (1) The place of <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">με</lemma>. This was possible, because <quote lang="greek">μέγα βάρος</quote>, without <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote>, could have stood as an adverbial cognate acc.: hence <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote> is rather a superfluity than a word for which the ear was waiting.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1281</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τί δ’ ἔστιν</lemma>. In order to form a judgment on this difficult verse, a careful scrutiny of Sophoclean usage is required. (1) The reading closest to the MSS. would be, <quote lang="greek">τί δ’ ἔστιν <emph>αὖ</emph>; κάκιον <emph>ἦ</emph> kakw=n e)/ti</quote>; This involves merely a change of punctuation, and of accent (<quote lang="greek">ἦ</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ἤ</quote>). But it suggests these difficulties. (<emph>a</emph>) The interrogative <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ</lemma> occurs about 50 times in Soph. : and in every instance it is the first word of the interrogative clause. Only a vocative sometimes precedes it, as <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1102" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1102</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὦ τέκνον, ἦ πάρεστον</quote></cit>; so <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

Phil. 369." valid="yes"> <title>Ph.</title> 369.</bibl>Eur. , indeed, does not always observe this rule: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. El. 967" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 967</bibl> <quote lang="greek">τί δῆτα δρῶμεν; μητέρ’ ἦ φονεύσομεν</quote></cit>; In <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Hec. 1013" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Hec.</title> 1013</bibl> I should point thus, <quote lang="greek">ποῦ δῆτα; πέπλων ἐντὸς ἦ κρύψασ’ ἔχεις</quote>; (<quote lang="greek">ἦ</quote> Valckenaer for <quote lang="greek">ἢ</quote>). But, if we read <quote lang="greek">κάκιον ἦ κακῶν ἔτι</quote> here, it would be a solitary departure from the practice of Soph. , as seen in fifty other examples. (<emph>b</emph>) The formula <quote lang="greek">τί δ’ ἔστι</quote> (cp. on v. 20) occurs 21 times in  Soph. (including  <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Phil. 733" valid="yes">Soph. <title>Ph.</title> 733</bibl>, where the MSS. give <quote lang="greek">τί ἔστι</quote> without <quote lang="greek">δ’</quote>) as a question complete in itself. But there is not one instance of <quote lang="greek">τί δ’ ἔστιν αὖ</quote>; which is, indeed, illsuited to the rhythm of the tragic senarius.</p>
<p>(2) Transposing <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">αὖ</lemma> and <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἤ</lemma>, we could read, <quote lang="greek">τί δ’ ἔστιν; <emph>ἢ</emph></quote> [or better, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἦ</lemma>] <quote lang="greek">κάκιον <emph>αὖ</emph> κακῶν ἔτι</quote>; But: (<emph>a</emph>) if this had been the original order, it is most improbable that <quote lang="greek">ἤ</quote> and <quote lang="greek">αὖ</quote> would have changed places. The sense would have been perfectly clear, whereas with <quote lang="greek">αὖ...ἤ</quote> (the order in the MSS.) it is obscure.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1289</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὦ παῖ</lemma>, said to the Messenger. It has been objected that, at such a time, Creon could not use those words except with reference to Haemon (as in 1266, 1340). From a modern literary point of view, the objection is just. But we should remember how very familiar <quote lang="greek">ὦ παῖ</quote> actually was as a mode of address, whether by elders to juniors, or by masters to slaves. Here it is used, not as to a slave, but merely as to a younger man; there is in it a certain pathetic appeal for sympathy. (Cp. <quote lang="greek">ὦ παῖ, ὦ τέκνον</quote>, as said by the Messenger to Oed. in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 1008" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 1008</bibl>, 1030.) Enger's conjecture, <quote lang="greek">ὢ τίν’</quote></p>
<p><quote lang="greek">αὖ</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">ὦ παῖ τίνα</quote>), has not much palaeographical probability. It gives, indeed, a closer correspondence with 1266. But the form of dochmiac which the MS. reading gives here is equally correct. (See  Analysis. Met.) Seidler was certainly right in omitting <quote lang="greek">λόγον</quote> (see cr. n.): and that remedy suffices.</p>
<p>Construe: <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">τίνα νέον σφάγιον γυναικεῖον μόρον λέγεις ἀμφικεῖσθαί μοι ἐπ’ ὀλέθρῳ</lemma>, ‘what new death,’—the bloody death of a woman,—dost thou describe as heaped on destruction (i.e., superadded to Haemon's death), for my sorrow (<quote lang="greek">μοι</quote>)?' (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 595" valid="yes">Cp. 595</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πήματα φθιτῶν ἐπὶ πήμασι πίπτοντ’</quote>.) <quote lang="greek"><emph>γυναικεῖον</emph> = γυναικός</quote>: cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Aesch.

The verb <quote lang="greek">ἀμφικεῖσθαι</quote> prop.=‘to be set around’ (as a wall round a city). Perhaps the bold phrase here was partly prompted by the fact that persons embracing each other could be described (<bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 1620" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 1620</bibl> n.) as <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοισιν ἀμφικείμενοι</quote>. I prefer this view.</p>
<p>But another version is possible, if <quote lang="greek">μοι</quote> is taken with <quote lang="greek">ἀμφικεῖσθαι</quote>: ‘besetting me,’ <quote lang="greek">ἐπ’ ὀλέθρῳ</quote>, for (my) ruin. <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

The difficulty is that <quote lang="greek">ἀμφικεῖσθαι</quote> cannot well be said of <emph>one</emph> sorrow (Eurydicè's death), and that, therefore, we have to evolve from the epithet <quote lang="greek">νέον</quote> the notion of a <emph>circle</emph> of woes of which this <quote lang="greek">μόρος</quote> is one. Thus the image would be much more obscurely expressed than that in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 351" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 351</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">ἴδεσθέ μ’ οἷον ἄρτι κῦμα φοινίας ὑπὸ ζάλης | ἀμφίδρομον κυκλεῖται</quote>, (‘behold what a surge hath but now burst around me and hemmed me in, under stress of a deadly storm,’) where Ajax is sitting in the midst of the carnage which he has wrought. It is altogether improbable that <quote lang="greek">ἀμφικεῖσθαι</quote> alludes to Eurydicè's corpse having been brought (by the <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote>) into such a position that Creon stood between it and Haemon's. See 1298, where Creon speaks of her as being <quote lang="greek">ἔναντα</quote>.

El. 1458" valid="yes"><title>El.</title> 1458</bibl> (the corpse of Clytaemnestra, with Orestes and Pylades beside it); and in <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 344" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 344</bibl> (Ajax in his tent among his victims). See Albert Müller, <title>Gr. Bühnenalterthümer</title>, pp. 142 ff. (1886).</p>
<p>Recent explorations in the Dionysiac theatre at Athens have given rise to a theory that there was no permanent raised stage or proscenium before the Roman age. Even if this could be proved, it would still, however, remain certain that some such expedient as the <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote> was used in the fifth century. This is proved by the texts of Aesch. , Soph. , and Eur. , as well as by the two scenes of  Ar. where the tragic <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote> is parodied ( <bibl default="NO" n="Aristoph. Ach. 408" valid="yes">Ar. <title>Ach.</title> 408</bibl>—479; <title>Thesm.</title> 95—238).  Ar. has the words <quote lang="greek">ἐκκυκλεῖν</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἐσκυκλεῖν</quote>. Wecklein thinks that the <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote> was employed when a part of the interior of the house was to be disclosed, but the <quote lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</quote> when merely a single object was to be shown; and that the <quote lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</quote> was used here (<title>N. Jahrb.</title> 1870, vol. 101, p. 572: <title>Philol.</title> 31. 451). The meaning of <quote lang="greek">ἐξώστρα</quote> is, however, doubtful.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1301</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἥδ’</lemma>: he indicates the dead body of Eurydicè, now made visible by the <quote lang="greek">ἐκκύκλημα</quote>.—Arndt's first emendation is given in the text. His later substitution of <quote lang="greek">πτώσιμος</quote> for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βωμία</lemma> was not an instance of second thoughts being wiser. The altar meant is that of <quote lang="greek">Ζεὺς Ἑρκεῖος</quote> in the <quote lang="greek">αὐλή</quote> of the house (487). The objection made to <quote lang="greek">βωμία</quote> here is to the effect that one could say <quote lang="greek">βώμιος ἐφέζεται</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἵσταται</quote>, but not <quote lang="greek">βώμιος ποιεῖ τι</quote>: i.e. that the verb must refer directly to the assuming of the position denoted by <quote lang="greek">βώμιος</quote>. It is quite true that this is usually the case; <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Supp. 93" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Suppl.</title> 93</bibl> <quote lang="greek">βωμίαν ἐφημένην</quote></cit>: <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 32" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 32</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἑζόμεσθ’ ἐφέστιοι</quote></cit>: and cp. above, 785 f. But here <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">βωμία</lemma> is not merely an adverbial word, to be taken closely with <quote lang="greek">λύει</quote>. It is rather an instance of an adj. used with the force of a participle, and virtually equivalent to <quote lang="greek">βωμία στᾶσα</quote>: i.e. it means, ‘having taken her place at the altar,’ she slew herself. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OC 83" valid="yes"><title>O. C.</title> 83</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὡς ἐμοῦ μόνης πέλας</quote></cit> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">οὔσης</quote>): and see above on 471. Further: even if it were necessary to bind <quote lang="greek">βωμία</quote> closely with <quote lang="greek">λύει</quote>, it would be bold to say that poetry could not permit this slight modification in the ordinary use of the word, when we remember how free was the adverbial use of adjectives in poetry (e.g., <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 217" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 217</bibl> <quote lang="greek">νύκτερος Αἴας ἀπελωβήθη</quote></cit>).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ξίφει</lemma>. A sacrificial knife, which lay on the altar. Cp. <bibl default="NO" n="Eur. Alc. 74" valid="yes">Eur. <title>Alc.</title> 74</bibl> (Death speaks) <quote lang="greek">στείχω δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτήν, ὡς κατάρξωμαι ξίφει</quote>. For the prep. cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 828" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 828</bibl> <quote lang="greek">πεπτῶτα τῷδε περὶ νεορράντῳ ξίφει</quote></cit>.</p>
<p>Next to Arndt's, the best conjecture seems that of Blaydes, <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἥδ’ ὀξυθήκτῳ σφαγίδι βωμίᾳ πέρι</lemma>. In favour of Arndt's we may observe:—（<emph>a</emph>) the MS. <quote lang="greek">πέριξ</quote> (a word not used by Soph. , and nowhere common) was not likely to have originated from <quote lang="greek">πέρι</quote> alone: whereas it could easily arise from <quote lang="greek">περὶ ξίφει</quote>, if <quote lang="greek">ίφει</quote> had been blotted or lost. (<emph>b</emph>) The MS. <quote lang="greek">ἥδε</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">ἡ δὲ</quote>) is just the kind of feeble make-shift which is sometimes found in the MSS., where a verse had come down in a mutilated state: see, e.g., on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 943" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 943</bibl> f., 1264 f.—For other conjectures, see Appendix.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1329</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">μόρων ὁ κάλλιστ’ ἔχων</lemma>. I have adopted <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote>, a conjecture of Pallis for <quote lang="greek">ἐμῶν</quote>, on the following grounds. (1) The phrase <quote lang="greek">μόρων ἐμῶν</quote> could mean nothing but, ‘of all fates possible for me.’ This, however, is most strange. In 1313 <quote lang="greek">μόρων</quote> meant ‘violent deaths’: so   <bibl default="NO" n="Aesch. Seven 420" valid="yes">Aesch. <title>Th.</title> 420</bibl><quote lang="greek">αἱματῃφόρους μόρους</quote>. Hence it has been proposed to render <quote lang="greek">μόρων ἐμῶν</quote> here, (<emph>a</emph>) ‘the deaths caused by me’: as Hermann, ‘veniat caedium per me factarum suprema, exoptatissime mihi ultimum diem adducens.’ (<emph>b</emph>) Figuratively, ‘the many deaths that I have died’; <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Ant. 1288" valid="yes">cp. 1288</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ὀλωλότ’ ἄνδρ’ ἐπεξειργάσω</quote>. But neither version is tolerable. (2) Triclinius proposed to make <quote lang="greek">ἐμῶν</quote> fem., and to take it with <quote lang="greek">τερμίαν</quote>: when it would at least be necessary to write <quote lang="greek">ἐμᾶν</quote> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">ἁμερᾶν</quote>). But, either with <quote lang="greek">ἐμῶν</quote> or with <quote lang="greek">ἐμᾶν</quote>, the relation of <quote lang="greek">ὁ κάλλιστ’ ...ἄγων</quote> to the gen. <quote lang="greek">μόρων</quote> is exceedingly awkward. ‘That one among fates which <emph>best</emph> brings my last day,’ cannot be explained as an equivalent for, ‘that best of fates which brings it’; i.e., for <quote lang="greek">μόρων ὁ κάλλιστος, ὁ...ἄγων</quote>.</p>
<p>Both these difficulties (which to me seem insuperable) are removed by reading <quote lang="greek">μόρων ὁ κάλλιστ’ <emph>ἔχων</emph></quote>, the best of fates. That <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote> could have been changed to <quote lang="greek">ἐμῶν</quote>, either by conjecture or by accident, is shown by v. 575, where at the end of the verse L has the probably true <quote lang="greek">ἐμοί</quote>, while other MSS. have <quote lang="greek">ἔφυ</quote>. (If <quote lang="greek">κύνες</quote> is right in 467, and <quote lang="greek">ξίφει</quote> in 1301, these, too, are instances of final words corrupted.) A question of punctuation remains. The comma might follow either <quote lang="greek">ἔχων</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ἐμοί</quote>. I prefer the latter. Cp. <cit><bibl default="NO" n="Soph. Aj. 394" valid="yes"><title>Ai.</title> 394</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ἰὼ σκότος, ἐμὸν φάος, | ἔρεβος ὦ φαεννότατον, ὡς ἐμοί</quote></cit>.

It has been usual to take <quote lang="greek">ὕπατος</quote> here as ‘last.’ But neither <quote lang="greek">ὕπατος</quote> nor <quote lang="greek">ὑπέρτατος</quote> ever bears that sense in classical Greek. Pindar often uses <quote lang="greek">ὕπατος</quote> as ‘best,’ but never as ‘last’: <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. O. 1" valid="yes"><title>O.</title> 1. 100</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 6" valid="yes"><title>P.</title> 6. 42</bibl> and <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. P. 10" valid="yes">10. 9</bibl>, <bibl default="NO" n="Pind. N. 10" valid="yes"><title>N.</title> 10. 32</bibl>. In post-classical poetry <quote lang="greek">ὕπατος</quote> sometimes means ‘last,’ but that use was imitated from the Lat. <foreign lang="la">supremus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">summus.</foreign> Thus in an epitaph on an Italian, a certain Aelius, Apollonides writes (<title>Anthol. P.</title> 7. 233), <quote lang="greek">νοῦσον ὅτ’ εἰς ὑπάτην ὠλίσθανε, τέρμα τ’ ἄφυκτον | εἶδεν</quote>. Whether the Apollonides of the Anthology was or was not he of Nicaea, who dedicated to Tiberius a commentary on Timon's <quote lang="greek">Σιλλοί</quote> (<bibl default="NO" n="D. L. 9.109" valid="yes">Diog. Laert. 9. 109</bibl>), at least he belonged to that age. This is proved by his words in  <title>Anthol. P.</title> 9. 287, <quote lang="greek">Ἠελίου νῆσον ὅτ’ εἶχε Νέρων</quote>, alluding to the residence of Tiberius at Rhodes (c. 6 B.C.— 2 A.D.). The epigram was written after Tiberius had been adopted by Augustus in 4 A.D., as he is called <quote lang="greek">Ζῆνα τὸν ἐσσόμενον</quote>, and perhaps after he had come to the throne (14 A.D.). It would be interesting to know whether <quote lang="greek">ὕπατος</quote> as =‘last’ can be carried back beyond the Roman, or later Alexandrian, age; I can find no trace of it.

He used the simple verb in his paraphrase in order to bring out the literal sense (as he took it) of <quote lang="greek">ἀπελύσατο</quote>. This is shown by <quote lang="greek">ἐφέρετο</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ἔπεσεν</quote>: he understood, ‘she was set free (as a runner in a race is dismissed from the starting-post), and rushed (<quote lang="greek">ἐφέρετο</quote>) to bloodshed.’—Further, the origin of L's reading is manifest. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐρῶ μὲν</lemma> had become <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἐρῶμεν</lemma> (as it actually is in at least one later MS.). Then the plur. <quote lang="greek">ἐρῶμεν</quote> seemed too harsh with the sing. <quote lang="greek">συγκατηυξάμην</quote> immediately following (though, in fact, it would have been quite defensible, <bibl default="NO" n="Soph.

<span class="line-ref">Line 1342</span><p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πρὸς πότερον … πάντα γάρ</lemma>. The reading of this verse cannot be certainly determined. The traditional text (see cr. n.) exceeds the metre. My own view is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The MS. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ὅπᾳ</lemma> should be struck out. It evidently came in from the margin, having been a gloss on <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πᾷ</lemma>, meant to show that <quote lang="greek">πᾷ κλιθῶ</quote> is not a direct question, but depends on <quote lang="greek">οὐδ’ ἔχω</quote>. Retaining <quote lang="greek">ὅπᾳ</quote>, we should have to suppose a double question: ‘nor do I know in what direction, (or) to which thing, I am to look.’ This is not only very awkward, but very weak. The hiatus after <quote lang="greek">ἔχω</quote>, though not unexampled, is at least another point against <quote lang="greek">ὅπᾳ</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) L has <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πάντα γάρ</lemma> in a line by itself: but, considering the caprices of lyric division in that MS. (as in the rest), we cannot urge that fact as a hint of interpolation. If <quote lang="greek">ὅπᾳ</quote> was a spurious addition to 1342, then <quote lang="greek">πάντα γάρ</quote> might easily have been carried over. Again, the words <quote lang="greek">πάντα γάρ</quote> are not indispensable; yet the effect of <quote lang="greek">λέχρια τἀν χεροῖν</quote>, without them, would be rather oddly abrupt. Therefore we are by no means warranted (I think) in ejecting <quote lang="greek">πάντα γάρ</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">κλιθῶ</lemma>, for <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">καὶ θῶ</lemma>, is certain. On this last point there is now a general agreement.—The resulting dochmiac differs from that in 1320 only by the ‘irrational’ long (the <quote lang="greek">ω</quote> of <quote lang="greek">ἴδω</quote>) for short (the first of <quote lang="greek">ἔτυμον</quote>): and this is admissible. See Metrical Analysis.—Other views are noticed in the Appendix.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πρὸς πότερον</lemma>, i.e., to the corpse of Haemon at his side, or to that of Eurydicè in front of him (1297 ff.).</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">ἴδω</lemma>, deliberative subjunct. in the indirect question, depending on <quote lang="greek">οὐκ ἔχω</quote>: cp. n. on <bibl default="NO" n="Soph. OT 72" valid="yes"><title>O. T.</title> 72</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πᾷ κλιθῶ</lemma>, in what direction I am to lean, i.e., where I am to find any support: my son and my wife have fallen: all my fortunes lie in ruin. <lemma from="ROOT" lang="greek" targOrder="U" to="DITTO">πᾷ</lemma> here answers to the dat. after <quote lang="greek">κλίνομαι</quote> when it means ‘to lean against’ a thing, as <bibl default="NO" n="Hom. Od. 6.307" valid="yes"><title>Od.</title> 6.307</bibl> (she sits) <quote lang="greek">κίονι κεκλιμένη</quote>.—Not merely, ‘whither I am to betake myself,’ <quote lang="greek">ποῖ τράπωμαι</quote>; This is shown by <quote lang="greek">λέχρια</quote>.
